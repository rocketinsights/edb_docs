You can create a local repository to act as a host for PEM RPM packages
if the server on which you wish to install PEM cannot directly access
the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level
overview of the steps required; you may need to modify the process for
your individual network. To create and use a local repository, you must:

1.  Download all the dependencies required for PEM on a machine with
    internet access using the following commands:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
yum install yum-plugin-downloadonly

mkdir /tmp/<pem_dir>

yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/<pem_dir>/ edb -pem edb-pem-server

mkdir /tmp/<epel_dir>

yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/<epel_dir>/ epel-release*
```

Where, `<pem_dir>` and `<epel_dir>` are the local directories that you
create for downloading the RPMs.

2.  Copy the directories `/tmp/<pem_dir>` and `/tmp/<epel_dir>` to the
    machine that is in the isolated network.
3.  Create the repositories:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
createrepo /tmp/<pem_dir>

createrepo /tmp/<epel_dir>
```

5.  Create a repository configuration file called
    `/etc/yum.repos.d/pem.repo` with connection information that
    specifies:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
[pemrepo]
name=PEM Repository
baseurl=file:///tmp/pem78/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

6.  Create a repository configuration file called
    `/etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo` with connection information that
    specifies:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
[epelrepo]
name=epel Repository
baseurl=file:///tmp/pem78/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

After specifying the location and connection information for your local
repository, you can use yum commands to install or upgrade PEM server:

  - To install PEM server:
    
    `yum install edb-pem edb-pem-server`

  - To upgrade PEM server:
    
    `yum upgrade edb-pem edb-pem-server`
