This section describes the basic concepts of a block-level incremental
backup (referred to as an incremental backup). An incremental backup is
functionality unique to BART.

An incremental backup provides a number of advantages when compared to
using a full backup:

  - The amount of time required to produce an incremental backup is
    generally less than a full backup, as modified relation blocks are
    saved instead of all full relation files of the database cluster.
  - An incremental backup uses less disk space than a full backup.

Generally, all BART features (such as retention policy management) apply
to incremental backups as well as full backups. See [Managing
Incremental Backups](managing_incremental_backups) for information about
retention policy management as applied to incremental backups.
