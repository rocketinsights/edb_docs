**EDB Cloud Database Service**

EDB Cloud Database Service (CDS) offers fast access to Postgres databases in a concierge-hosted service. In minutes, CDS configures a cluster of database machines with:

  - Monitoring
  - Streaming replication
  - Connection pooling
  - Load balancing
  - Automatic failover (transaction or recovery time preferred)
  - Secure data encryption
  - Rotating user-scheduled backups
  - Point-in-time recovery
  - Elastic storage
  - Elastic scale out

Simplified deployment allows you to take advantage of automatic scaling of storage resources and scale out of read replicas when a database cluster reaches user-defined thresholds. This provides unattended, around-the-clock responsiveness to unpredictable load demands on your database infrastructure without management responsibilities associated with a self-managed cloud network.

This document is written to acquaint you with the process of deploying on Cloud Database Service; it is not a comprehensive guide to using CDS or Postgres database products.
