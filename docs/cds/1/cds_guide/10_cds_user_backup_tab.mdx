Use the `Backups` tab to manage cluster backups; the tab displays a list of the available backups.

![*The Backups tab.*](images/cds_backups_tab.png)

A backup captures and stores the status and condition of a cluster at a specific point-in-time. Click a column heading to sort the column contents; click again to reverse the sort order.

  - The `ID` column contains a unique backup identifier.
  - The `CLUSTER` column displays the name of the cluster that was the target of the backup.
  - The `NOTES` column displays an informational note (provided by either the user or the system at the time of backup). Those messages that include (PITR) can be restored to a specific point-in-time within the backup window.
  - The `ENGINE VERSION` column contains a description of the Postgres version that the saved cluster is using.
  - The `CAPACITY` column contains the storage capacity of the cluster at the time that the backup was taken.
  - The `STARTED` column displays the date and time that the backup was initiated.
  - The `ENDED` column displays the data and time that the backup completed.

Use the icons on the left side of the `Backups` tab to restore or delete backups:
