title: "The Teams/Users Tab"
---

A *team* is group of users with collective permissions to access the different tabs of the administrative console based on the role(s) associated with the team. When you create (or modify) a team, you can assign membership in a role to that team. Each user in a team inherits all of the roles (privileges) of that team.

An organization can have multiple teams; similarly, a user may be a member of multiple teams.

Roles are predefined:

  - The `Billing` role provides access to view your account's invoices.
  - The `Provisioning` role provides access to create, update/upgrade, and delete database clusters or backups.
  - The `Support` role provides access to documentation, white papers, support forums, and CDS support (you can send an e-mail to <cds-help@enterprisedb.com> to log tickets).
  - The `User Management` role provides access to create, edit or delete teams and other team members.
  - The `Organization Admin` role provides access to update payment or organization details, buy reserved CDS instances, opt for enterprise support, or view account's current usage, etc.

You can use the `Teams/Users` tab to define teams and assign membership in a team to one or more users.
