**Reserved Instances**

When you reserve instances, you agree to use a pre-determined instance type for a specified length of time; EnterpriseDB offers a deep discount on the instance price for reserved instances. The discount price automatically applies to existing running instances (of the same instance type) starting from the date of purchase.

## Using Reserved Instances

You can reserve Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database instances for Cloud Database Service for a one year term. Using reserved instances provides substantial savings for:

>   - Steady state use cases
>   - Database instances for your production applications
>   - Mission critical applications that run on Multi-AZ database deployments for higher availability and data durability

The discount price automatically applies to existing running instances (of the same instance type) starting from the date of purchase. For more information about reserved instances, visit the [EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-postgres-cds/) .
