**EDB Postgres Ark**

> EDB Ark automatically provisions EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL databases in single instances, high-availability clusters, or application development sandboxes. EDB Ark allows service providers and organizations to offer elastic and highly scalable database-as-a-service (DBaaS) environments while freeing DBAs and application developers from the rigors of setting up and administering modern and robust database environments.

In minutes, EDB Ark configures a cluster of database machines with:

>   - Monitoring
>   - Streaming replication
>   - Connection pooling
>   - Load balancing
>   - Automatic failover (transaction or recovery time preferred)
>   - Secure data encryption
>   - Rotating user-scheduled backups
>   - Point-in-time recovery
>   - Elastic storage
>   - Elastic scale out

EDB Ark's automatic scaling of storage resources and scale out of read replicas when a database cluster reaches user-defined thresholds provides unattended, around-the-clock responsiveness to unpredictable load demands on your database infrastructure.

The following features have been added to the EDB Ark user console for this release.

<div class="index">

New Features

</div>

  - Ark now supports EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL version 12 database clusters.
  - EnterpriseDB has introduced a new RPM repository structure that combines the contents of the previous three repositories into a single repository. The new structure is supported by Ark. For information about connecting to the repository, visit <https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>.
  - Ark now provides extended support for multi-region features (including manual promotion and API support).
  - You can use the `Promote` option (located on a cluster's context menu in the `Details` panel) to replace the master node with a standby node. For more information, see the EDB Postgres Ark Getting Started Guide.
  - The `/templates` and `/templates/id` resources now support the `region` property.
  - Support for Amazon `r4.*` and `r5.8x` instance types has been reinstated.

## Limitations

**Cloning, Recovering, or Scaling Encrypted Clusters from Previous Versions**

Encrypted clusters created with Ark 3.3 or prior may not be used to clone, recover, or scale to a machine type that is not supported by that earlier version. If you will be moving encrypted clusters created with Ark version 3.3 or prior to a new machine type (as supported by Ark 3.4 or 3.5), you will need to:

1.  Clone the encrypted cluster to a new, unencrypted cluster.
2.  Upgrade the Ark console on which the cluster resides.
3.  Clone the unencrypted cluster to a new encrypted cluster of the new machine type.

For detailed information about cloning a cluster, see the *EDB Postgres Ark Getting Started Guide*.

**Cloning with a Template from a Foreign Region**

You cannot use a template when cloning from a foreign region.

**Monitoring a Federated Console with PEM**

Ark does not support federated consoles configured in local PEM server mode.

**Federating Consoles that host clusters with the Same Name**

If you are upgrading to version 3.4 or 3.5, and plan to federate existing Ark version 3.3 consoles that host clusters with the same name, you must first create a clone of one of the clusters specifying an alternate name; federated consoles cannot be used to host clusters with the same name. For example, if you plan to federate two consoles that both contain a cluster named `acctg`, you should clone one of the clusters specifying an alternate name for the cluster (i.e. `acctg-west`). Then, you can federate the consoles; both consoles will have access to `acctg` and `acctg-west`.

The Ark console and API are designed to help you easily create and manage high-availability database clusters.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Traditionally, the expression *cluster* refers to a single instance of Postgres managing multiple databases; an EDB Ark database server cluster is a collection of high-availability Postgres server instances that reside in a cloud or on a traditional network.

</div>

When you create a new cluster (a group of replicated database servers), EDB Ark initializes one or more Postgres instances (virtual machines) according to your specifications. EDB Ark uses Postgres streaming replication to synchronize replicas in the cluster, and pgpool-II to implement load balancing and connection pooling among all active instances.

![EDB Postgres Ark Architecture](images/ark_architecture_overview.png)

The master node of the cluster contains a host operating system with a running instance of Postgres, along with the load balancer. Database modifications are automatically routed to the master node; any modifications to the master node are subsequently propagated to each replica using Postgres streaming replication.

EDB Ark installs Postgres on each replica node in a read-only hot-standby role that automatically duplicates all data found on the master node, and all changes made to that data. In hot-standby mode, the data is available to service user queries providing read scalability to the cluster. In addition, any schema changes made to the master are also replicated to the replica nodes, making development and deployment of application changes easy and seamless without interruption to normal operations.

![EDB Postgres Ark Architecture](images/ark_architecture_load_balancing.png)

Replicas provide balanced user support as needed - if any instance in the cluster goes offline, the cluster's load is re-balanced among the remaining servers while the instance is automatically replaced.

When used in the default healing configuration, in the event of a failure of the master node, an existing replica is used to replace the failed master node. While the replica nodes are standing by, they are read-only resources, load balancing client queries without a risk of compromising data integrity.

EDB Ark automatically archives data at regular intervals; you can specify a convenient backup window and how many backups to retain when creating a database cluster. EDB Ark also offers backup on demand - simply click the Backup icon to save a copy of the instance. Automatic backups are retained according to your specifications; while on-demand backups are retained until you delete them. Each backup is a complete copy of the cluster; you can use a backup to restore a cluster.

EDB Ark makes it easy to scale a database cluster:

  - To increase read performance, you can add read replicas to the cluster (manually or automatically).
  - To handle expanding data requirements you can increase the amount of storage available (manually or automatically).
  - To increase the RAM or CPU processing power of the cluster's underlying virtual machine, you can manually scale a cluster into a more appropriate server class.

## Using Ark on an AWS Virtual Private Cloud

EDB Ark can create and manage clusters that reside on Amazon-hosted virtual private clouds (VPCs). A VPC is similar in structure to a traditional network, but provides the scalability and ease of maintenance offered by cloud computing.

A VPC is an isolated network with a unique IP address range and subnet addresses. When deploying a cluster, you can use the Ark console to select the VPC on which the new cluster will reside, or choose to have Ark create a new VPC.

![EDB Postgres Ark Architecture](images/ark_architecture_overview_create_new_cluster.png)

To create a new cluster that resides on a private subnet, log into the Ark console and click the `Launch DB Cluster` button. Use the `Create a new Server Cluster` dialog to provide details about the cluster configuration. Check the box to the left of `Use Private IP addresses` to display only those VPCs which have a NAT gateway configured to support private subnets in the VPC field. Then, use the `VPC` drop-down menu to select a VPC.

After completing the `Step 1` tab, use the `Next` key to continue. Provide information in the fields on each additional tab before selecting the `Launch` button and deploying your cluster into your private subnet. For detailed information about the additional options available when defining a cluster, please see the EDB Ark Getting Started Guide, available via the Ark console dashboard.

Please note: if you use private IP addresses, the master instance is not assigned an elastic IP address. Should a failover occur, the IP address of the master instance will change.

### Using a NAT Gateway

You can deploy the Ark console on a VPC, and use a [network address translation (NAT)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) gateway to provide access to services outside of the VPC. The NAT gateway allows an instance without a public IP address to securely access services and resources such as yum repositories.

When the Ark console is deployed in a private subnet (or without a public IP address), the console can only communicate with private networks in its own VPC or peered VPCs. Clusters are restricted to deploying into VPCs that have a peering connection to the VPC in which the console is deployed, and the console's VPC.

A [peering connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/PeeringGuide/Welcome.html) allows you to route traffic between two virtual private clouds without exposing the clouds to outside connections.

Please note: when the Ark console is deployed in a private subnet, the `Use Private IP addresses` option is always `true`.

title: "Registering an Ark Cluster with PEM"
---

<div id="ark_registering_with_pem" class="registered_link"></div>


Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) is an enterprise management tool designed to assist database administrators, system architects, and performance analysts in administering, monitoring, and tuning PostgreSQL and EnterpriseDB Advanced Server database servers. PEM can manage and monitor a handful of servers or hundreds of servers from a single console, allowing complete control over all aspects of your databases.

A PEM installation consists of a PEM server, one or more PEM agents, and the backing database server (named <span class="title-ref">pem</span>). The PEM server includes a web interface that allows you to monitor and manage the database instances that are registered with a PEM agent. A PEM agent is responsible for returning metric information to the PEM server, and performing tasks on the database instances that are registered with that agent.

The Ark console installation includes a pre-configured PEM server, a PEM agent, and the pem backing database. You also have the option of using a remote PEM server to monitor your Ark console. A remote server is a PEM server that has been installed and configured on another host.

![*Specifying Deployment Details*](images/ark_registering_with_pem.png)

During deployment, you will be prompted to use the `PEM Server Mode` drop-down listbox to select a deployment mode:

  - Select `DISABLE` to indicate that clusters deployed on the host should not be registered with the PEM server.
  - Select `LOCAL` to indicate that you would like to use the PEM server that resides on your local host. If you select LOCAL, the PEM deployment will use default values assigned by the installer.
      - The IP address of the PEM server host will be the IP address of the Ark host.
      - The PEM Server DB Port will monitor port `5432`.
      - The PEM server database user will be named `postgres`.
      - The password associated with the PEM server will be the same password as the Ark console.
  - Select `REMOTE` to indicate that you would like to use a PEM server that resides on another host, and provide connection information on the Ark console deployment dialog.
      - Provide the IP address of the PEM server host in the `PEM Server IP Address` field.
      - Specify the port monitored for connections by the PEM server in the `PEM Server DB Port` field.
      - Specify the port monitored for API connections in the `PEM Server API Port` field.
      - Provide the name that should be used when authenticating with the PEM server in the `PEM Server Username` field.
      - Provide the password associated with the PEM server user in the `PEM Server Password` field.

If you select `REMOTE`, whenever a new cluster node is created on this console, it will be registered for monitoring by the PEM server. Please note that you must modify the [pg_hba.conf](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html) file of the pem database on the remote PEM server to accept connections from the host of the Ark console.

## Syncing with the PEM Server

When you register with PEM during console deployment, the *PEM Sync Mode* field will be enabled. Use the drop-down listbox in the PEM Sync Mode field to specify your preference for synchronizing with the PEM server.

If you select `DISABLED`:

  - Any object that Ark registers with PEM will be owned by the PEM user specified in the PEM Server *Username* field (if the PEM server is a REMOTE server), or by <span class="title-ref">postgres</span> (if the PEM server resides on the host of the LOCAL Ark server).
  - Any Ark user that registers with a console instance will not be added as a PEM user.

If you select `ENABLED`:

  - Any Amazon Role or Azure Group that is accessible by the Ark user that is deploying the console is added to the PEM server as a group role. The PEM role created for the project, role, or group is not a login role. To simplify management, each role that represents a project, role, or group is also a member of the PEM `ark-team` group role.

![*The PEM Group Role dialog*](images/ark_registering_with_pem_group_role_dialog.png)

  - Each user that registers with a monitored Ark instance is also created as a PEM login user. The user account will be displayed in the `Login/Group Roles` node of the PEM client tree control. To access the properties dialog for the user, right click on the user name, and select `Properties` from the context menu.
    
    Each PEM user account that corresponds with a registered Ark user will belong to the `ark-user` role. The PEM user account will also have membership in any `ark-team` roles that have been created to correspond to the project, role, or groups that the Ark user has permission to access.

![*The PEM Login Role dialog*](images/ark_registering_with_pem_login_role_dialog.png)

The PEM user account is not password enabled. To set a password for the account, an administrative user must navigate to the PEM role's `Definition` tab, and provide a password in the `Password` field.

If you use the Ark console to delete an Ark user, the synchronization service will disable the corresponding user on the PEM server. The service will ensure that membership in ark-user is revoked, and the role will no longer be a `LOGIN` role. Please note that the sync service will only modify those roles that are a member of the ark-user team.

The sync service will also ensure that the corresponding pem-team role is deleted if a tenant, group, or role is deleted on an Ark host.

![*Registering as a login role*](images/ark_registering_with_pem_login_role_dialog_password.png)

Ark will sync with PEM on the schedule specified by the `PEM Synchronization Interval` field. The field accepts interval values in minutes; by default, Ark will attempt to syncronize every 10 minutes.

<div id="monitoring_cluster" class="registered_link"></div>

<div class="index">

Monitoring an Ark Cluster

</div>

## Monitoring an Ark Cluster

After deployment, you can access the PEM web interface in your choice of browser:

  - If the PEM server resides on a local host, navigate to: `https://<address_of_ark_server>/pem`
  - If the PEM server resides on a remote host, navigate to: `https://<address_of_remote_pem_server>:<port>/pem`

When prompted, provide the PEM credentials to connect.

![*Logging on to the PEM Server*](images/ark_registering_with_pem_logon.png)

If you have registered the Ark console with a remote PEM server during deployment, use the PEM server credentials to connect.

If you have deployed the PEM server locally (on the Ark host), the password associated with the Ark backing database will be used for the PEM server. Unless you have modified the password (either during deployment in the DB User New Password field, or after deployment in the console backing database), the Ark database superuser has the following connection credentials at deployment:

> name: `postgres`
> 
> password: `0f42d1934a1a19f3d25d6288f2a3272c6143fc5d`

You should [change the password](10_ark_console_management#ark_console_management) after deployment to a unique password (known only to trusted users).

After authenticating with the server, the PEM web interface allows you to manage your monitored nodes.

![*The PEM Global Overview*](images/ark_registering_with_pem_global_overview.png)

When you launch an Ark cluster on a console that is registered with PEM, Ark will register each node of the cluster with the PEM server for monitoring. Each node of an Ark cluster, and the agent that resides on the node is displayed in a Group-level heading in the PEM web interface `Browser` tree control. The node name is:

> `Ark-Cluster<cluster_name>`

Where `<cluster_name>` is the name assigned to the cluster.

Right click on the IP address of a cluster node, and provide the password specified when the cluster was provisioned to authenticate with the database and view the database objects that reside on the cluster in the tree control.

PEM documentation is available via the PEM web interface Help menu, or at [the EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/edb-postgres-platform/edb-postgres-enterprise-managerpem/).

**Known Limitations**

If your Ark clusters are provisioned with private IP addresses, they may not be reachable from the PEM server. If this is the case, you will not be able to use PEM to remotely browse the database server. PEM agents running on the Ark cluster nodes will be able to report status to the PEM Server.

Please note that the user identifier associated with an Ark cluster (the cluster owner) must be unique across all Ark consoles supported by a given PEM server.

<div id="pem_agent" class="registered_link"></div>

<div class="index">

Registering a PEM Agent

</div>

## Registering a PEM Agent

The PEM agent is responsible for executing tasks and reporting statistics from a monitored Postgres instance to the PEM server. The PEM agent is installed by the pem-agent RPM. By default, all engine configurations shipped with the Ark console include the PEM agent.

![*PEM Architecture*](images/ark_registering_with_pem_architecture.png)

After installing the PEM agent, the agent must be registered on each node that will be monitored by the PEM server. The steps that follow detail registering the PEM agent with the server, and configuring the server to monitor the agent.

Please note that before registering a node for monitoring, you must:

>   - modify the `pg_hba.conf` file on the node hosting the PEM server to allow connections from any monitored node.
>   - modify the `pg_hba.conf` file on any monitored node, allowing connections from the PEM server.
>   - configure the agent on each monitored node.

The steps that follow provide detailed information about each configuration step. The steps assume that you have installed and configured a PEM server; for information about installing and configuring PEM, please visit the EnterpriseDB website at www.enterprisedb.com.

**Please note:** when a cluster node is stopped (for example, when scaling down), or if a cluster is deleted, the `Monitoring` tab of the PEM web interface will alert you that the agent on that node is down.

If the cluster has been deleted (and the agent will not resume monitoring), you can use the PEM `Browser` tree control to remove the agent definition from the PEM server. Expand the PEM Agents node of the tree control, and right-click on the name of the deleted agent; then, select `Delete/Drop` from the context menu.

**1. Create an EDB Ark Cluster**

Navigate to the Clusters tab, and create a new cluster that is provisioned using an engine definition that includes the pem-agent RPM package in the list of required RPM packages. For detailed information about creating a new server cluster, please see the `EDB Ark Getting Started Guide`, available through the Ark console's `Dashboard` tab.

**2. Modify the pg_hba.conf file to allow connections to the PEM Server**

The PEM server consists of an instance of PostgreSQL, an associated PostgreSQL database for storage of monitoring data, and a server that provides web services for the PEM web interface. The PEM server may reside on a host outside of a monitored EDB Ark cluster, or on the master node of an Ark cluster.

Before a PEM agent that resides on an Ark cluster can communicate with the PEM server, you must modify the `pg_hba.conf` file of the PostgreSQL database that stores PEM statistics to allow connections from any monitored servers as well as the PEM client.

With your choice of editor, modify the `pg_hba.conf` file of the PEM Server backing database, adding entries for the IP address of the EDB Ark cluster. The connection properties should allow connections that use `cert` and `md5` authentication.

![*Modifying the pg_hba.conf file*](images/ark_registering_with_pem_pg_hba.png)

**3. Restart the PEM Server Database**

After modifying the pg_hba.conf file for the PostgreSQL installation that stores statistical information for PEM, you must restart the PEM backing database server to apply the changes. The name of the PEM service is:

> `postgresql-<x>`

Where <span class="title-ref">\<x\></span>\` specifies the version. For example, the following command restarts a PostgreSQL 10 service:

> `service postgresql-10 restart`

Use your platform and version-specific command to restart the PEM server.

**4. Establish an SSH Session with the Monitored Node of the Ark Cluster**

Use the `Download SSH Key` icon on the `Clusters` tab to download the SSH key for your cluster. When you download the key, a popup will open, informing you of the steps required to connect to the master node of your cluster.

![*Connecting with SSH*](images/ark_registering_with_pem_ssh_session.png)

Open a terminal window, modify the permissions on the downloaded file, and use the command shown on the popup to establish a connection with the server.

**5. Modify the pg_hba.conf file to Allow Connections from the PEM Server**

Use your choice of editor to modify the pg_hba.conf file on the Ark node. By default, the pg_hba.conf file is located in `/var/lib/ppas/<x.x>/data`, where `<x.x>` specifies the Ark server version.

Add entries to the `pg_hba.conf` file that allow connections from the PEM server.

**6. Restart the Database Server on the Ark Cluster**

After modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, you must restart the server to apply the changes. The name of the service is `Arkdb`. Use the platform and version specific command for your cluster to restart the `Arkdb` service.

**7. Configuring the PEM Agent**

You must register each PEM agent that resides in an Ark cluster with the PEM server. Using the SSH connection to the cluster node on which the agent resides, navigate into the directory that contains the PEM agent installation:

> `cd /usr/pem-7.0/bin`

Then, invoke the PEM agent registration program:

> `PGPASSWORD=password ./pemagent --register-agent --pem-server <x.x.x.x> --pem-port <port> --pem-user <user_name>`

Where:

> `<x.x.x.x>` specifies the IP address of the PEM server.
> 
> `<port>` specifies the port on which the server is listening for connections
> 
> `<user_name>` specifies the name of the PEM user.

The program will confirm that the agent was registered successfully.

![*The agent is registered successfully*](images/ark_registering_with_pem_registered_successfully.png)

After registering the agent, use the following command to ensure that the service is configured to restart when if the node restarts, and that the pemagent service is running:

> `chkconfig pemagent on && service pemagent start`

title: "Ark Authentication Models"
---

<div id="ark_authentication_models" class="registered_link"></div>


When deploying the console, you can specify the type of authentication used by the Ark console. Authentication can be native password (provided by the service provider), or performed by the PostgreSQL backing database that resides on the host of the Ark console.

**Using Native Password Authentication**

When using native password authentication, an Administrative user must:

  - On AWS: use the `User Administration` section of the Ark `Admin` tab to register Ark users.
  - On Azure: use the Azure console to create user accounts and manage user access.

**Using PostgreSQL Authentication**

Ark supports using the following PostgreSQL authentication types:

  - PASSWORD
  - LDAP
  - RADIUS
  - PAM
  - BSD

For information about configuring authentication on a Postgres server, please consult the [Postgres documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/en/10/pg/client-authentication.html) available at the EnterpriseDB website.

If you choose to use PostgreSQL authentication when deploying the Ark console, an Administrative user must:

  - On AWS: add each user to the Ark backing database, and then use the `User Administration` section of the Ark `Admin` tab to register Ark users. On an Amazon host, the user name and associated password specified in the Ark backing database must match the credentials specified when registering the user in the Ark console.
  - On Azure: add each user to the Ark backing database. Registration will be complete when the user logs in to the Ark console.

You can use the psql client to add a user to the postgres database. To use the psql client, SSH to the host of the Ark console; navigate into the `bin` directory, and connect to the psql client with the command:

> `./psql –d postgres –U postgres`

When prompted, supply the password of the postgres database user. After connecting to the database, you can use the `CREATE ROLE` command to add a user to the database:

> `ADD USER <user_name> WITH PASSWORD <password>;`

Where:

> `<user_name>` specifies the name of the Ark user. `<password>` specifies the password associated with the user name.

For detailed information about using the [psql client](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/en/10/pg/app-psql.html) please see the Postgres documentation.

After the administrative user adds the end-user, the end-user will complete the registration process by navigating to the URL of the console, and logging in.

## Using Provider Authentication on AWS

If you use authentication provided by Amazon, an Ark Administrative user can use the Ark Administrator's console to add, modify, or delete user accounts.

![*Using Provider Authentication on AWS*](images/ark_authentication_models_aws_provider_auth.png)

When the user provides credentials to the Ark console, the credentials are passed to Amazon for verification. If the credentials are successfully verified, the role is evaluated to determine if the user should have access to the Administrator console or the end-user console.

</div>

## Using PostgreSQL Authentication on AWS

When Postgres authentication is enabled, the first user to log in becomes the service user.

![*Using PostgreSQL Authentication on AWS*](images/ark_authentication_models_aws_pg_auth.png)

An Ark Administrative user must use a client application (such as psql or PEM) to add each user to the Ark backing database, and then use the User Administration table to register Ark users. The user name and associated password specified in the Ark backing database must match the credentials specified when registering the user in the Ark console. If Ark successfully verifies the credentials, the credentials are passed to Amazon for evaluation to determine console access.

## Using Provider Authentication on Azure

If you use native password authentication provided by Azure you must use the Azure Active Directory console to create and manage user accounts.

![*Using Provider Authentication on Azure*](images/ark_authentication_models_azure_provider_auth.png)

When the user provides credentials to the Ark console, the credentials are passed to the provider for verification. If the credentials are successfully verified, the role is evaluated to determine if the user should have access to the Administrator console or the end-user console.

<div id="pg_on_Azure" class="registered_link"></div>

<div class="index">

</div>

## Using PostgreSQL Authentication on Azure

When Postgres authentication is enabled on Azure, the first user to log in to the Ark console becomes the service user. An administrator will be required to use either the PEM web interface or psql to add each successive user to the Ark backing database. User registration will be completed when the end user logs in to the Ark console.

![*Using PostgreSQL Authentication on Azure*](images/ark_authentication_models_azure_pg_auth.png)

The credentials of the Ark service user are verified by the provider; all other credentials are verified by the Postgres server on the Ark console host. If Ark successfully verifies the credentials, the credentials are then evaluated to determine console access.

<div id="ark_installing_console" class="registered_link"></div>


Some features of the Ark Administrative console will not work properly when pop-up blocker (or Ad blocker) software is enabled. To take full advantage of console features, you should disable pop-up blocker software from restricting pop-ups from the URL/s used by the Ark console or Ark clusters. After disabling pop-up blocker software for your console, follow the platform specific steps to deploy an Ark console:

  - If your cluster resides on an Amazon public cloud, see [Installing the Ark Console on AWS](06_ark_installing_console/01_ark_installing_console_aws#ark_installing_console_aws) for more information.
  - If your cluster uses an Azure host, see [Installing the Ark Console on Azure](06_ark_installing_console/02_ark_installing_console_azure#ark_installing_console_azure) for more information.

The EDB Ark console is distributed through the Amazon AWS Marketplace in an Amazon machine instance. To install the Ark console on your Amazon instance, you will need to:

  - Launch an [Ark instance](../06_ark_installing_console/01_ark_installing_console_aws#launch_ark_aws) with an Amazon AWS Marketplace AMI.
  - Create an [Amazon role](../06_ark_installing_console/01_ark_installing_console_aws#creating_aws_service_user) and [register an administrative user](../06_ark_installing_console/01_ark_installing_console_aws#creating_aws_service_role) .
  - Configure the [Ark console](../06_ark_installing_console/01_ark_installing_console_aws#config_ark_console) .
  - Create an Amazon role and [register an Ark console user](../06_ark_installing_console/01_ark_installing_console_aws#create_aws_role_register_ark_user) .

<div id="launch_ark_aws" class="registered_link"></div>

<div class="index">

Launching the Ark Console on AWS

</div>

## Launching the Ark Console Instance on AWS

Before launching an AMI into an Amazon VPC, you must ensure that the VPC has access to an [Internet Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html). If your VPC does not have access to an Internet Gateway, you can use the Amazon management console to create an Internet Gateway and associate it with your VPC.

Please note: if you are using EC2-Classic networking, you do not need to provide an Internet Gateway.

To launch an Amazon EC2 instance that contains a running copy of the Ark console and the Ark console's backing database, connect to your Amazon AWS Marketplace account and locate the AMI that contains the Ark console. Navigate through the introductory page for the AMI, selecting AWS service options that are appropriate to your application, and agreeing to the `Terms and Conditions`. When you agree to the `Terms and Conditions`, Amazon will process the subscription.

After you subscribe, Amazon will forward an email to the address associated with your user account that includes [launch instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launching-instance.html) for the AMI.

Then, use the Amazon launch wizard to launch your instance, noting the requirements that follow on `Step 3` and `Step 6` of the wizard.

![*Step 3 - Enabling the startup script*](../images/ark_installing_console_aws_step_3_details.png)

When configuring your instance, you should include the following selections on the `Step 3: Configure Instance Details` dialog of the Amazon launch wizard:

  - Use the `Auto-assign Public IP` drop-down to specify Enable to automatically assign an IP address to the new instance.
  - Use the `Advanced Details` section to provide the text of the script that will start the Ark console setup or recovery dialog.

<!-- end list -->

``` text
#!/bin/sh
rm -f /usr/share/tomcat/startup-password.txt
echo "<console_password>" > /usr/share/tomcat/startup-password.txt
chown tomcat:tomcat /usr/share/tomcat/startup-password.txt
chmod 600 /usr/share/tomcat/startup-password.txt
```

Replace the `<console_password>` variable in the script with a password for the console. When the user first connects to the AWS Ark console, they will be required to provide the console password provided in the script.

Continue through the launch wizard; please note that when configuring your security group, the group must allow communication between the nodes of the cluster. When defining the security group, include the rules listed in the table below.

| Rule Type  | Direction | Port or Range | Remote | CIDR Address |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| All ICMP   | Ingress   |               | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| SSH        |           |               | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| HTTP       |           |               | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| HTTPS      |           |               | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| Custom TCP | Ingress   | 6666          | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| Custom TCP | Ingress   | 7800 to 7999  | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| Custom TCP | Ingress   | 5432          | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |

**Please Note:**

  - The CIDR addresses specified in the rules for SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and 5432 can be customized to restrict access to a limited set of users.
  - The CIDR addresses specified for port 6666 and ports 7800 through 7999 must specify a value of `0.0.0.0/0`.
  - The Custom TCP rule that opens ports 7800 through 7999 provides enough ports for 200 cluster connections; the upper limit of the port range can be extended if more than 200 clusters are required.

Creating the AWS Service User and Role

</div>

## Creating the Amazon AWS Service User and Service Role

Before configuring the Ark console on an Amazon host and creating users, you must create an Amazon service user and service role. Ark uses the service role when performing Ark management functions (such as console backups). The Ark console uses the service role credentials (the cross account keys) to assume the IAM roles assigned to Ark users. This enables Ark to securely manage AWS resources. When configuring the Ark console, you are required to provide the setup dialog with details about the AWS service user and the service role. Specify:

  - the Amazon Role ARN (resource name) that will be used by the Ark service in the `Service Account Role ARN` field.
  - the Amazon external ID that will be used by the Ark service user in the `Service Account External ID` field.
  - the AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID associated with the AWS role used for account administration in `AWS Access Key` field.
  - the AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY associated with the AWS role used for account administration in `AWS Secret Key` field.

Creating an AWS Role and Registering an Ark User

</div>

## Creating an Amazon Role and Registering an Ark Console User

After deploying the console, you must create an Amazon role with an associated security policy that will be applied to the Ark console user. You can use the same security policy for multiple users, or create additional Amazon roles with custom security policies for additional users. Each time you register a user, you will be prompted for a Role ARN. The Role ARN determines which security policy will be applied to that user.

To define an Amazon role, connect to the Amazon management console, and navigate through the `Identity and Access Management` dashboard to the `Roles` dashboard, and click the `Create role` button.

![*The Create role dialog*](../images/ark_installing_console_aws_create_iam_role.png)

Creating a Security Group on Azure

</div>

## Creating a Security Group

Before connecting to the Ark console, you must create a security group that will allow connections from your web browser, and between the Ark console and your instance. To create a security group, navigate to the Microsoft Azure `Network security groups` page, and click the `Add` button. When the `Create network security group` panel opens:

  - Use the `Name` field to provide a name for the security group.
  - Use the drop-down listbox in the `Subscription` field to select a subscription plan.
  - Use the `Resource` group field to provide a name for the associated resource group, or highlight the Use existing radio button and use the drop-down listbox in the Resource group field to select an existing resource group.
  - Use the `Location` drop-down listbox to specify a location.

When you've finished, click `Create` to create a network security group.

After creating the network security group, you must provide the inbound rules that will allow the Ark console to manage your instance. On the Network security groups page, click the name of the security group that you wish to modify; click `Inbound security rules` (in the `SETTINGS` section of the details panel) to modify the inbound rules for the group.

To add a new rule, click the `Add` button, and provide details about the rule; after providing rule details, click `OK`. The Azure console will notify you that it is creating the new rule. When defining the security group, include the rules listed below:

| Rule Type               | Direction | Port                         | Remote              | CIDR Address                            |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| All ICMP SSH HTTP HTTPS | Ingress   |                              | CIDR CIDR CIDR CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Custom TCP              | Ingress   | 6666                         | CIDR                | 0.0.0.0/0                               |
| Custom TCP              | Ingress   | port range from 7800 to 7999 | CIDR                | 0.0.0.0/0                               |
| Custom TCP              | Ingress   | 5432                         | CIDR                | 0.0.0.0/0                               |

The CIDR addresses specified in the rules for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS can be customized to restrict access to a limited set of users. The CIDR addresses specified for port `6666` and ports `7800 through 7999` must specify a value of `0.0.0.0/0`.

The rule that opens ports `7800` through `7999` provides enough ports for 200 cluster connections; you can extend the upper limit of the port range if more than 200 clusters are required.

<div id="ark_using_admin_tab" class="registered_link"></div>


Use options on the `Admin` tab to perform administrative tasks such as creating federations of consoles, managing servers and database engines, and defining templates. You can also use the `Admin` tab to manage users and deployment properties.

![*The Admin tab.*](images/ark_admin_features_admin_tab.png)

**Console Manager**

Use the fields in the `Console Manager` panel to:

  - Make a console available through the `Consoles` drop-down navigation listbox on the Ark console.
  - Generate a token that can be used to configure the current console as part of a *federation* of Ark consoles. A federated console can deploy resources (such as standby servers) on another console that resides in another region.
  - Register other consoles with the current console as part of a *federation* of consoles.

For more information, see [Using the Console Manager](#using-the-console-manager).

**Server Type Administration**

A fresh installation of EDB Ark will include default database engine configurations for:

  - EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10.0, and 11 (64-bit)
  - PostgreSQL 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10.0, and 11 (64-bit)

For information about adding additional servers, see [Managing Server Images](#managing-server-images).

**DB Engine Administration**

The databases made available through the `DB Engine Administration` panel will be disabled and will not have an associated server type or valid repository information. To make a database available for end users, you must:

  - Create one or more server images that correspond to a server that resides on your system. For more information about defining a server type, see [Managing Server Images](#managing-server-images).
  - Use the `Edit Engine Details` button to modify existing engine definitions to specify a server image associated with the engine and repository information (if applicable), and enable the engine for use by end-users.

For more information, see [Managing Database Engines](#managing-database-engines).

**Template Administration**

Use the `Template Administration` panel to create and manage database cluster templates. A template contains a predefined set of server options that determine the configuration of a cluster.

An administrator can use a template to:

  - simplify creation of clusters that use a common configuration.
  - predefine supported cluster configurations.
  - limit access to server resources for a *Template Only* user. A Template Only user must use a template when deploying a new cluster.

For more information about creating and using a template, see [Template Administration](#template-administration).

**RHEL Subscription Management**

Options in the `RHEL Subscription Management` panel allow you to:

  - Add, modify, or delete RHEL subscription information.

For more information, see [Red Hat Subscription Management](#red-hat-subscription-management).

**IAM Roles Administration (AWS only)**

Options in the `IAM Roles Administration` panel allow you to:

  - Make Amazon ARNs available for use in Ark user accounts (AWS).

For information about user administration options, see [Managing Amazon Roles](#managing-amazon-roles).

**User Administration**

Options in the `User Administration` panel allow you to:

  - If applicable, manage user accounts.
  - Access a list of currently connected users.
  - Display a banner message to connected users.
  - Specify that a user must use a template when deploying a cluster.

For information about user administration options, see [User Administration](#user-administration).

**Download Console Logs**

Click the `Download` button in the `Download Console Logs` panel to download a zip file that contains the server logs for the underlying application server. You can use the log file to confirm changes to server status or verify server activity.

For more information, see [Accessing the Console Logs](#accessing-the-console-logs).

**Download Core Usage Logs**

Click the `Download` button in the `Download Core Usage Logs` panel to download a zip file that contains the usage logs for the underlying server.

For more information, see [Accessing the Core Usage Logs](#accessing-the-core-usage-logs).

**Backup Ark Console**

Click the `Backup Now` button to start a console backup. A popup will confirm that you have requested a manual backup of the console.

For more information, see [Taking a Manual Backup of the Console](#taking-a-manual-backup-of-the-console).

**Edit Installation Properties**

Click the `Edit installation properties` button to open a dialog that allows you to modify the Ark console configuration. For more information, see [Editing Installation Properties](#editing-installation-properties).

Console Manager

</div>

## Using the Console Manager

Use fields in the `Console Manager` panel to manage the names and links displayed by the `Consoles` drop-down listbox on the Ark console. You can also use the Console Manager to manage federated consoles and provide access to cross-region resources. The console manager provides access to optional functionality; if you are not federating consoles or do not wish to use the `Consoles` drop-down, you are not required to complete the fields in the panel.

For more information about creating and using federated consoles, see [Using the Console Manager to Create a Federated Console](08_ark_admin_tab#register_federated_console).

![*The Consoles drop-down.*](images/ark_admin_tab_console_switcher.png)

The `Consoles` drop-down listbox (in the upper-right corner of the Ark console) provides quick access to other consoles. When you select a name from the `Consoles` drop-down listbox, the Ark console opens a browser tab and navigates to the address associated with the name. Use the `Console Manager` section of the `Admin` tab to manage the console names and addresses that are displayed in the `Consoles` drop-down.

![*The Console Manager panel*](images/ark_admin_tab_console_switcher_pane.png)

To enable the `Consoles` drop-down, you must first provide a name for the console to which you are currently connected in the `Name for this Console` field.

![*Provide a name for the console.*](images/ark_admin_tab_console_switcher_enable.png)

After providing the console name, click the `Save Name` button to display the name of the console in the upper-left corner of the Ark console, and in the `Consoles` drop-down. To add a shortcut to another console, click the `Add Console` button; the `Add Console` dialog opens.

![*Saving the console name.*](images/ark_admin_tab_console_switcher_add_url.png)

Then, use the `Add Console` dialog to provide information about the console for which you are creating a `Consoles` entry:

  - Provide a user-friendly name in the `Name` field.
  - Provide the URL of the console in the `Url` field; please note that the URL must be prefixed with the http protocol identifier.
  - Optionally, provide the API token associated with the console in the `API Token` field. This field is only required when you are federating consoles.

When you're finished, click the `Save` button to add the console to the list displayed on the `Consoles` drop-down.

To modify an entry in the `Consoles` drop-down, highlight the name of the console in the `NAME` column and click the `Edit Console` button. After modifying the console details on the `Edit Console` dialog, click the `Apply` button to preserve the changes. Click `Cancel` to exit the dialog without saving your changes.

To remove a URL, highlight the name of the URL in the `NAME` column and click the `Delete Console` button. A dialog will open, asking you to confirm that you wish to delete the Console.

![*Deleting a console.*](images/ark_admin_tab_console_switcher_delete_url.png)

Click the `Delete` button to confirm that you want to remove the entry from the `Consoles` drop-down and delete the entry from the `Console Manager` table, or click `Cancel` to exit the dialog without deleting the entry.

Federated console Cross-region resources

</div>

### Using the Console Manager to Create a Federated Console

You can use fields in the `Console Manager` panel to generate and share access tokens between consoles to create a *federation* of consoles. After creating a federation, you can create or clone cluster members in any region in which one of the federated consoles resides. A federated console may have resources that reside in more than one region; standby nodes that reside in other regions will reflect the state of the master node.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Each federation may only contain one console from a specific region; if you try to add more than one console from a given region to a federation, Ark will return an error.

</div>

When creating a federation, please note:

  - All of the federated consoles must be configured with the same set of database engines and server images:
    
    >   - Each database engine must have the same configuration across all federated consoles (including the engine id and name).
    >   - Each server image must have the same configuration across all federated consoles; the image id will vary by region.

For example, you might have two consoles; one that resides in Region `us-east-1` and one that resides in Region `us-east-2`. You can create a federation of those consoles by *registering* the consoles with each other. After registering the consoles (sharing the URL and token of each console within the federation with the other console), you will be allowed to select the `Region` in which replica nodes are created or cloned.

![*Selecting a region.*](images/ark_admin_tab_create_cross_region.png)

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Standby nodes that reside in a different region than the master console will be used for load balancing. Failover to nodes that reside on a different region than the master node is not supported. If a master node fails and you do not have a standby node in the same region as the master node, Ark will create a replacement node in the same region as the original master.

</div>

All of the resources that reside on federated consoles will be visible on the `Clusters` tab of all of the consoles within the federation. To federate consoles you must:

1.  Use the `Name for this Console` field to create a name for each console that will be federated. Click within the field and provide a console name; when finished, click the `Save Name` button. The console name will be displayed on the title bar of the Ark console.

![*Providing a console name.*](images/ark_admin_tab_name_console.png)

2.  Click the `Generate API Token` button to create a token for the console. The API token is displayed in the `API Token for this Console` field.

![*Generating an API token.*](images/ark_admin_tab_generate_token.png)

3.  Use the `Add Console` dialog on each console within the federation to register the other consoles with which they will be federated.

![*Registering a console.*](images/ark_admin_tab_register_console.png)

After registering each with all of the other consoles within the federation, you will be allowed to create resources in any region in which the federated consoles reside.

**Revoking a Token**

Select the `Revoke API Token` button to revoke the token assigned to the console.

![*Confirm you wish to revoke the token.*](images/ark_admin_tab_token_revoke.png)

If the console is a member of a federation, the other members of the federation will no longer be able to create resources in the area in which the console resides. To restore membership in a federation, you must generate a new token for the console and edit the console definitions of the other federation members, updating the token associated with the console.

After creating a federation, you can:

  - Log in to any federated console and initiate a cluster backup.
  - Log in to any federated console and delete a cluster.
  - Initiate a clone operation regardless of the region in which the node resides.
  - Log in to any federated console and initiate a yum update on a cluster.
  - Scale a federated cluster in multiple regions.
  - Perform machine scaling on a cluster that resides on a federated console.

<div class="index">

Managing Server Images

</div>

## Managing Server Images

A server definition describes the virtual machine that will host an instance of Advanced Server or PostgreSQL. Use the `Server Type Administration` panel to manage server images.

![*The Server Type Administration section of the Admin tab*](images/ark_admin_tab_manage_server_pane.png)

**Creating a Server Image**

To create a new server image, connect to the Ark console as a user with administrative privileges, navigate to the Admin tab, and select `Add Server`. The `Add Server` dialog opens.

![*The Add Server dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_create_server.png)

Use the fields on the `Add Server` dialog to define a new server:

  - Use the `Server ID` field to provide an identifier for the server image. The `Server ID` must be unique, and may not be modified after saving the server image.
  - Use the `Server Description` field to provide a description of the server image.
  - Use the `Image ID` field to provide the Image ID of the server image.

**On Amazon**

> If you are using Ark with Amazon, provide the `AMI ID` in the `Image ID` field. Please note: you should use a server from a trusted source, with a virtualization type of hvm. We recommend using the official Amazon images from the Amazon AWS Marketplace.

**On Azure**

> If you are using an Ark with Azure, you can use the Azure CLI interface to retrieve a list of the machine images that are available in the Azure Marketplace. Review the Azure documentation for information about [downloading and installing the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). After installing the Azure CLI, you can use one of the following commands to retrieve a list of the available images for a specific platform and version:

| Version   | Command                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RHEL 7:   | az vm image list --offer RHEL --sku 7. --output table --all   |
| CentOS 7: | az vm image list --offer CentOS --sku 7. --output table --all |

Select an image from a trusted publisher; when configuring the Ark console, provide the first three elements of the Urn column in the `Server Image ID` field. For example, if the Urn returned by the CLI is `RedHat:RHEL:7.2:7.2.20160921 7.2.20160921`, the Image ID is `RedHat:RHEL:7.2`.

Some recommended images and providers are:

  - RedHat:RHEL:7-RAW
  - OpenLogic:CentOS:7.5

Use the `Initial User` field to provide the name of the default operating system user. This user must have `sudo root` privileges to perform the initial provisioning of software on the node.

If you are using an Amazon AWS Marketplace image, the default user name is associated with the backing image; for more information about image user identities, review [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html).

  - Use the `System Type` field drop-down listbox to select the operating system type of the server; select CentOS or RHEL.
  - Check the box next to `Statically Provisioned` to indicate that the server is statically provisioned. A statically provisioned server is a pre-installed image that contains the software required to create a database cluster.

For detailed information about creating a statically provisioned image, please see [Creating a Statically Provisioned Image](12_ark_statically_provisioned#ark_statically_provisioned).

When you have completed the dialog, click `Save` to create the server image, or `Cancel` to exit without saving.

**Modifying a Server**

Click the `Edit Server Details` button to open the `Edit Server Details` dialog and modify the properties of a server.

![*The Edit Server dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_modify_server.png)

After modifying the server definition, click `Save` to make the changes persistent and exit the dialog, or `Cancel` to exit without saving.

**Deleting a Server**

To delete a server definition, highlight a server name, and select the `Delete Server` button. If no engines are dependent on the server, a dialog will open, asking you to confirm that you wish to delete the selected server type.

![*The Delete Server Type dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_delete_server.png)

Select the `Delete` key to remove the server, or `Cancel` to exit without removing the server.

![*You cannot remove a server with dependencies*](images/ark_admin_tab_delete_server_error.png)

Please note: If the server is currently used by an engine, the Ark console will advise you that the server cannot be removed; before removing the server, you must delete any dependent engines.

<div id="manage_db_engines" class="registered_link"></div>

<div class="index">

Managing Database Engines

</div>

## Managing Database Engines

An engine definition pairs a Postgres server type with the server image on which it will reside. Only an EDB Ark administrative user can define an engine. Once defined, all of the engines that reside within a specific role or group will be made available to all users with access to that group. You can use the `DB Engine Administration` section of the Admin tab to create and manage database engines.

![*The DB Engine Administration section of the Admin tab*](images/ark_admin_tab_manage_db_engine_pane.png)

**Please note:** The EnterpriseDB repository structure has changed; after upgrading your Ark console to v3.5, you will have a combination of old and new DB engine configurations in the Ark `Admin` panel. You should migrate to the new DB engines for all new clusters since these contain the proper EDB YUM repository configuration.

The Ark console ships with a number of default engine definitions. Before using an engine, you must create a server (see [Managing Server Images](#managing-server-images)) and edit the engine details, associating a server with the engine you wish to use and enabling the engine.

The following engines are shipped with Ark. Engine definitions may include multiple repositories to provide access to all of the packages required to complete the installation. Advanced Server repositories require you to provide a USERNAME and associated PASSWORD; for credentials, visit the [EnterpriseDB website](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

Managing Engine Definitions

</div>

## Adding, Modifying, or Deleting Engine Definitions

Use the `Add Engine` dialog to define an engine. To access the `Add Engine` dialog, connect to the Ark console as a user with administrative privileges, navigate to the `Admin` tab, and select `Add Engine`.

![*The Add Engine dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_add_db_engine.png)

Use the fields on the `Add Engine` dialog to define a new server image/database pairing; please note that some fields are disabled if the server is statically provisioned:

  - Use the `ID` field to provide an identifier for the engine. Please note that the identifier must be unique, and may not be modified after saving the engine.

  - Use the drop-down listbox in the `DB Type` field to select the type of database used in the pairing.

  - Use the drop-down listbox in the `Version` field to specify the server version.

  - Use the `Name` field to provide a name for the pairing. When the engine is enabled, the specified name will be included for use on the `Create Cluster` dialog.

  - Use the drop-down listbox in the `Server Type` field to specify the server image on which the database will reside. The drop-down listbox displays those images previously defined on the Add Server dialog.

  - Use the drop-down listbox in the `RHEL Subscription` field to select the Red Hat Subscription Manager service that will be used by the engine. To populate the RHEL Subscription drop-down, describe your subscription services in the RHEL Subscription Management section of the Admin tab. RHEL Subscription Manager services are only applicable for RHEL 7 clusters.
    
    Please note that you must delete any instances that use an engine that is associated with a RHEL subscription before you can delete the RHEL subscription.

  - Use the `Yum repo URL` field to provide the URL of the yum repository that will be used to initially provision database packages and to later update the database packages during cluster upgrade operations. When specifying multiple repositories in the Yum repo URL field, specify one repository per line. When you perform an update, any available updates in all of the specified repositories will be applied. The repository URL should take the form:
    
    `http://<user_name>:<password>@<repository_url>`
    
    Where:
    
    > `user_name` specifies the name of a user with sufficient privileges to access the repository.
    > 
    > `password` specifies the password associated with the repository user. Please note that if your password contains special characters (such as a $), you may need to percent-encode the characters.
    > 
    > `repository_url` specifies the URL of the repository.
    
    Please contact your EnterpriseDB account manager if you need connection credentials for the EnterpriseDB repositories, or visit [the EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/advanced-downloads).

  - Use the `Required DB Packages` field to provide a space-delimited list of packages that have been tested by EDB as the required minimum set to build a functional cluster instance.

When defining a database engine, you must specify the required package list for the installation in the Required DB packages field on the `Edit Engine Details` dialog.

  - Use the `Optional Node Packages` field to provide the names of any packages that should be installed (from the specified repository) on every cluster node during provisioning.

Please note: packages added via the `Optional Node Packages` field on the master node of the cluster will also be provisioned on any standby nodes that are subsequently created. If the package requires manual configuration steps, you will be required to repeat those steps on each node of the cluster; package configurations will not be propagated to standby nodes. If you add a node through cluster operations (such as failover, scaling, or restoring a node from backup), any packages on the new node will require manual configuration.

When you have completed the dialog, click `Save` to create the engine definition, or `Cancel` to exit without saving.

For information about using the EnterpriseDB repository, and the Advanced Server packages available, please see the [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide](http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/products/documentation/enterpriseedition).

**Modifying an Engine**

To modify an engine, use the `Edit Engine Details` button to open the `Edit Engine Details` dialog.

![*The Edit Engine Details dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_modify_db_engine.png)

Use fields on the Edit Engine dialog to specify property changes to an engine. When you’re finished, click the `Save` button to make the changes persistent and exit, or `Cancel` to exit without saving.

**Disabling an Engine**

You can use the disabled box to specify that an engine is (or is not) available for use in new clusters without removing the engine definition:

  - If the box next to disabled is checked, the engine will not be available for use.
  - If the box next to disabled is unchecked, the engine will be available for use.

Click the `Save` button to make any changes to the `Edit Engine Details` dialog persistent, or select `Cancel` to exit without modifying the engine definition.

Please note that disabling an engine has no impact on any running clusters; it simple prevents users from creating new clusters with the engine. You can use this feature to phase out the use of older engines.

**Deleting an Engine**

To delete an engine, highlight an engine name in the `DB Engine Administration` list, and select the `Delete Engine` button. A dialog will open, asking you to confirm that you wish to delete the selected engine.

![*The Delete DB Engine dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_delete_db_engine.png)

Click the `Delete` button to remove the engine definition, or select `Cancel` to exit without removing the engine definition.

Please note that you cannot remove an engine that is referenced by one or more clusters and/or backups; if you attempt to remove an engine that is in use, EDB Ark will display a warning message.

Adding Components to a DB Engine

</div>

## Adding Supporting Components to a Database Engine Definition

When you create a cluster, you specify the engine that EDB Ark will use when provisioning that cluster. If you modify the engine description, adding the list of RPM packages that will be installed when that engine is provisioned, each node of any cluster provisioned with that engine will include the functionality of the supporting component.

**Adding PostGIS to a Database Engine**

To simplify PostGIS installation, add a list of the required RPM packages to the `Optional Node Packages` field of the `Edit Engine Details` dialog. To provision replicas that contain the PostGIS functions, perform the installation and create the extensions on the master node of the cluster before adding replica nodes to your cluster.

To modify an engine description, use Administrative credentials to connect to the Ark console, and navigate to the `Admin` tab. Select an engine ID from the list of engines in the `DB Engine Administration` list, and click `Edit Engine Details`.

![*Modifying the Engine Details dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_add_postgis_db_engine.png)

When the `Edit Engine Details` dialog opens, use the fields on the dialog to specify the repository information and the names of optional RPM packages that the installer should provision on each node of the cluster.

  - The PostGIS RPM packages are distributed from the `enterprisedb tools` repository; by default, the `enterprisedb tools` repository is included in the `Yum Repo URL` field.
  - Add the names of the PostGIS RPM packages to the `Optional Node Packages` field on the `Edit Engine Details` dialog.

The PostGIS installation packages for Advanced Server 9.4 are:

> `ppas94-postgis`
> 
> `ppas94-postgis-core`
> 
> `ppas94-postgis-docs`
> 
> `ppas94-postgis-utils`

The PostGIS installation packages for Advanced Server 9.5 are:

> `ppas95-postgis`
> 
> `ppas95-postgis-core`
> 
> `ppas95-postgis-docs`
> 
> `ppas95-postgis-utils`

The PostGIS installation packages for Advanced Server 9.6 are:

> `edb-as-96-postgis`
> 
> `edb-as-96-postgis-core`
> 
> `edb-as-96-postgis-docs`
> 
> `edb-as-96-postgis-utils`

The PostGIS installation packages for Advanced Server 10 are:

> `edb-as-10-postgis`
> 
> `edb-as-10-postgis-core`
> 
> `edb-as-10-postgis-docs`
> 
> `edb-as-10-postgis-utils`

The PostGIS installation packages for Advanced Server 11 are:

> `edb-as-11-postgis`
> 
> `edb-as-11-postgis-core`
> 
> `edb-as-11-postgis-docs`
> 
> `edb-as-11-postgis-jdbc`
> 
> `edb-as-11-postgis-utils`

Any EDB Ark clusters that are subsequently provisioned with that engine will automatically include an installation of the PostGIS on all nodes of the cluster.

**Creating the PostGIS Extensions**

After adding the packages to the master node of a cluster, you can use the psql client or the EDB Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) client to create the extensions. Before connecting with a client, an Administrator must open the listener port (by default, `5444` on an Advanced Server instance) of the node for connections.

Use a client to connect to the database in which you wish to create the extensions, and enter the following commands:

``` text
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION fuzzystrmatch;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_tiger_geocoder;
```

The client will confirm that the extensions have been created successfully. The PostGIS functions are created in the public schema of the database.

Visit the PostGIS project site for detailed information about using [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/documentation/).

Template Administration

</div>

## Template Administration

A template contains a predefined set of server options that determine the configuration of a database cluster. A template can simplify creation of clusters that use a common configuration, or limit user access to costly resources such as large server classes. Use functionality offered in the `Template Administration` panel to create and manage templates.

![*The Template Administration section of the Admin dashboard*](images/ark_admin_tab_template_pane.png)

Use the `TEMPLATES ONLY` column of the `User Administration` table to specify that a user must use a template. A `Template Only` user will have access to only those templates that specify a role or tenant in which they have membership in the `Select Roles` section of the `Add Template` dialog.

If a user is specified as a `Template Only` user:

  - They must use a template when deploying a cluster.
  - They will be restricted to the scaling policies defined in the template.
  - They cannot modify a manually-defined cluster created by another user.
  - They can only create clusters in a server class that exists in an available template.
  - They must use a template when cloning or restoring from backup.
  - They may only delete backups of template created clusters.
  - They may not delete last backup of a template created cluster if the cluster had been deleted (removing the last artifact of any cluster).

To create a template, click the `Add Template` button; the `Add Template` dialog opens.

![*The Template Administration section of the Admin dashboard*](images/ark_admin_tab_add_template.png)

Use fields on the `Add Template` dialog to define a new template:

  - Provide a user-friendly name for the template in the `Template Name` field.
  - Use the `Description` field to provide a description of the template.
  - Use the drop-down listbox in the `Engine Version` field to select the version of the Postgres engine that you wish to use on clusters configured by the template.
  - Use the drop-down listbox in the `Server Class` field to specify the size of each cluster node. The server class determines the size and type (compute power and RAM) of any cluster configured by the template.
  - If your cluster resides on an Amazon AMI, use the drop-down listbox in the `VPC` field to specify the identity of the network in which clusters configured by the template should reside.
  - Use the drop-down listbox in the `Number of nodes` field to specify the number of nodes that should be created in each cluster.
  - Use the `Storage GB` field to specify the initial size of the data space (in Gigabytes).
  - Check the box next to `Encrypted` to indicate that the cluster should be encrypted. EDB Ark uses the aes-xts-plain (512-bit) cipher suite to provide an encryption environment that is both secure and transparent to connecting clients. When encryption is enabled, everything residing on the cluster is encrypted except for the root filesystem.
  - If the cluster will reside on an AWS host, check the box next to `EBS Optimized` to specify that the cluster should use an Amazon EBS-optimized instance and provisioned IOPS to guarantee a level of I/O performance.
  - The `IOPS` field is enabled for those clusters that will reside on an EBS-optimized instance. If applicable, specify the level of I/O performance that will be maintained for the cluster by automatic scaling. The maximum value is 30 times the size of your cluster; for example, if you have a 4 Gigabyte cluster, you can specify a maximum value of 120.
  - Check the box next to `Perform OS and Software` update to specify that a software update should be performed whenever the cluster is provisioned. Please note: this option is disabled if the cluster uses a statically provisioned server.
  - Use the `Number of backups` field to specify the number of backups that will be retained for the cluster. When the specified number of server backups is reached, EDB Ark will delete the oldest backup to make room for a new backup.
  - Use the `Backup Window` field to specify a time that it is convenient to perform a cluster backup.
  - Check the box next to `Continuous Archiving (Point-in-Time Recovery)` to enable point-in-time recovery for the cluster. When enabled, a base backup is automatically performed that can to be used to restore to a specific point in time. All subsequent automatic scheduled backups will also support point-in-time recovery.
  - Check the boxes next to the options in the `Select Scaling Options` box to indicate which options will be available to template users. Check the box next to:
      - `Manually Scale Replicas` to specify that users of this template will be allowed to manually scale replica nodes configured by this template.
      - `Manually Scale Storage` to specify that users of this template will be allowed to manually scale storage on clusters configured by this template.
      - `Auto Scale Replicas` to specify that users of this template will be able to configure automatic node scaling for clusters configured by this template.
      - `Auto Scale Storage` to specify that users of this template will be able to configure automatic storage scaling for clusters configured by this template.
  - Check the box to the left of a role name in the `Select Roles` box to indicate that members of the selected role can use the template.

When you've completed the `Add Template` dialog, click `Save` to create the defined template; click `Cancel` to close the dialog and exit without saving your work.

If you select `Launch From Template` on the `Create a New Server Cluster` dialog, you will be prompted to select the template you wish to use from the `Template Name` drop-down listbox. After selecting a template, you can use the `Full Template Details` link to open a popup that displays detailed information about the configuration of clusters deployed with the template.

Red Hat Subscription Management

</div>

## Red Hat Subscription Management

You can use the Ark Administrative console to attach Red Hat Subscription Manager information to engines hosted on Red Hat consoles. The Red Hat Subscription Manager tracks installed products and subscriptions to implement content management with tools like yum. Visit the Red Hat website for information about [Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-subscription-management/).

When you create a new cluster that uses an engine that is associated with a Red Hat subscription, Ark registers the cluster nodes with Red Hat; when you terminate the node, the system's subcription is unregistered.

Use the `RHEL Subscription Management` section of the Admin tab to define and manage Red Hat Subscription Manager access for your Ark consoles that reside on Red Hat Linux instances.

![*The RHEL Subscription Management section.*](images/ark_admin_tab_rhel_sub_mgmt_pane.png)

After creating a subscription definition, use options in the `DB Engine Administration` panel to associate the definition with database engines.

![*The Add RHEL Subscription dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_add_rhel_sub.png)

Use fields on the `Add RHEL Subscription` dialog to describe a Red Hat subscription service:

  - Use the `Subscription ID` field to provide a user-friendly name for the subscription. The name will identify the subscription in the RHEL Subscription drop-down on the Add Engine Details dialog.
  - Use the `Username` field to provide the name of the user account registered with the Red Hat content server.
  - Use the `Password` field to provide the password associated with the user account.
  - Use the `Server URL` field to provide the host name of the subscription server used by the service; if left blank, the default value of subscription.rhn.redhat.com will be used.
  - Use the `Base URL` field to provide the host name of the content delivery server used by the service; if left blank, the default value of <https://cdn.redhat.com> will be used.
  - Use the `Org` field to provide the organization that will be registered with the Red Hat subscription system.
  - Use the `Environment` field to provide the name of the environment (within the organization that will be registered).
  - Use the `Name` field to provide the name of the system that will be registered.
  - Use the `Activation Key` field to provide the activation key of the Red Hat subscription.
  - If enabled, use the `Auto-attach` checkbox to instruct any node associated with the subscription to automatically attach to the service.
  - If applicable, use the `Pool` field to provide the pool identifier for the Red Hat subscription service.
  - If applicable, check the `Auto` checkbox to indicate that nodes provisioned with engines associated with the pool will automatically attach to the subscription service.
  - If applicable, use the `Quantity` field to provide the number of subscriptions in the subscription pool.
  - Use the `Service Level` field to provide the service level of the subscription.
  - Use the `Release` field to provide the operating system minor release that will be used when identifying updates to any nodes provisioned with the subscription.
  - Check the `Force` checkbox to indicate that the node should be registered, even if it is already registered.
  - Use the `Type` field to specify the type of consumer that is being registered; the default is system.
  - The `Required Repos` list is populated by the Ark console, and displays a list of the repositories required by the subscription definition.
  - Use the `Additional Repos` field to provide the names of any additional repositories that should be enabled on the cluster node(s).
  - Use the `Disabled Repos` field to provide the names of any repositories that should be disabled on the cluster node(s).

When you've completed the dialog, click the `Save` button to add the repository to the table in the RHEL Subscription Management section, or `Cancel` to exit without saving. If you choose to save the definition, the Ark console will display a popup that lists the subscription manager commands that were generated as a result of your selections.

![*RHEL Subscription details*](images/ark_admin_tab_rhel_sub_details.png)

After creating a subscription definition, use options in the `DB Engine Administration` section of the `Admin` tab to associate the definition with database engines; see [Managing Database Engines](#managing-database-engines) for detailed information.

**Modifying a RHEL Subscription Definition**

To modify the description of a Red Hat Subscription Manager service, highlight the name of a subscription in the `RHEL Subscription Management` table, and click the `Edit RHEL Subscription` button. The `Edit RHEL Subscription Details` dialog opens, allowing you to modify the subscription definition.

After modifying the subscription definition, click `Save` to preserve your changes and exit the dialog; to exit without saving, click the `Cancel` button. Please note that changes made to a definition are applied only to those instances that are created after the changes are saved; changes are not propagated to existing instances.

  - The date and time of the last login is displayed in the `LAST LOGIN` column. The time zone displayed is based on the time zone used by the operating system.
  - The `LOGINS` column displays a cumulative total of the number of times that the user has logged in.

After adding the user to the Ark console, use the psql client application to add the user to the backing `postgres` database. To use the psql client, SSH to the host of the Ark console. Then, navigate into the `bin` directory, and connect to the psql client with the command:

> `./psql –d postgres –U postgres`

When prompted, supply the password of the postgres database user. After connecting to the database, you can use the `CREATE ROLE` command to add a user to the database:

> `ADD USER user_name WITH PASSWORD 'password';`

Where:

> `user_name` specifies the name of the Ark user.
> 
> `password` specifies the password associated with the user name.

Please note: The user name and associated password specified in the Ark backing database must match the credentials specified when registering the user in the Ark console.

For detailed information about using the psql client please see the [Postgres core documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/en/10/pg/app-psql.html).

After the administrative user adds the end-user, the end-user will complete the registration process by navigating to the URL of the console, and logging in.

## Changing Console Passwords

A fresh installation of the Ark console includes a PostgreSQL installation that is used to manage the console; the management database is named postgres. By default, the database superuser has the following connection credentials:

> name: `postgres` password: `0f42d1934a1a19f3d25d6288f2a3272c6143fc5d`

You should change the password on the PostgreSQL server to a unique password (known only to trusted users). You can set the password when you deploy the console or modify the password later on the `Edit Installation Properties` dialog. To open the `Edit Installation Properties` dialog, navigate to the `Admin` tab of the Ark console and click the `Edit Installation Properties` button.

![*Changing console passwords*](images/changing_console_passwords.png)

Fields near the bottom of the dialog allow you to modify the password:

  - Use the `DB User New Password` field to modify the database password.
  - Use the `DB User Confirm Password` field to confirm the new password.

After providing a new password and confirming the password, click the `Save` button. The console will inform you that it needs to restart the server to complete the password change. When prompted, click the <span class="title-ref">Restart</span> button. When the restart is complete, you will be required to log in to the server again.

**Please note:** if you modify the password of the Ark console, the password of the PEM server that resides on the Ark console will change as well. When using the PEM web interface to connect to the PEM server, use the password assigned to the Ark console.

## Customizing the Console

The majority of the console layout is defined in source files and cannot be changed without compilation, but you can modify several aspects of the user interface, including:

  - Background images
  - Background colors
  - Fonts
  - Font colors

To change the colors, fonts, or images displayed by the console, you can use ssh to connect to the console host; once connected, use your choice of editor to modify the files that control the onscreen display.

**Modifying the Console Display**

To modify the console display, use ssh to connect to the host of the Ark console: After connecting to the console host, you can use your choice of editor to modify the files that control the look and feel of the console host.

**Please Note: We recommend that you make a backup of any file that you plan to modify before changing the file.**

**The css File**

The css rules for the EDB Ark user console are stored in the `styles.css` file. The file is located at:

> `/usr/share/tomcat/webapps/PPCDConsole/WEB‑INF/classes/VAADIN/themes/pcsconsole/styles.css`

Please refer to comments within the file for detailed information about modifying individual components within the console display.

Some modifications to the styles.css file will be visible when you reload the page in your browser; if a change is not immediately visible, restart the server to apply the changes. If a change is not visible after restarting the server, you may need to clear your browser cache.

**The images Directory**

To modify the images that are displayed by the console user interface, replace the `.png` files in the `images` directory with the images you wish to display. The `images` directory is located at:

> `/usr/share/tomcat/webapps/PPCDConsole/VAADIN/themes/pcsconsole/images`

Please note that the logo displayed on the login screen is defined in the `i18n.properties` file; for more information about modifying the logo image, please refer to comments in that file.

**The html Template File**

The `loginscreen.html` template file defines the page layout for the login screen and the terms of use URL (referenced on the login screen). The file is located at:

> `/usr/share/tomcat/webapps/PPCDConsole/WEB-INF/classes/com/enterprisedb/pcs/ui/loginscreen.html`

**The properties File**

Use the `i18n.properties` file to modify text and external URLs displayed in the Ark console. The `i18n.properties` file is located at:

> `/usr/share/tomcat/webapps/PPCDConsole/WEB-INF/classes/i18n.properties`

Comments within the `i18n.properties` files identify the onscreen information controlled by each entry in the file. You must restart the server to apply any modifications to the properties file.

## Managing Console Logs

By default, Ark console log files are written to `/var/log/edb-ark/ark.log`. Log files are rotated on a daily basis, and stored for 30 days.

You can use the `ark.server.level` property to manage the level of detail saved in the Ark console log files. The `ark.server.level` property resides in:

> `/usr/share/tomcat/webapps/PPCDConsole/WEB-INF/classes`

To modify the value, connect to the Ark console, and use your choice of editor to modify the property value. The valid values are:

| Property Value | Information Logged                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SEVERE         | Includes the least amount of information in the log files (i.e., exceptions and ERROR messages). |
| WARNING        | Includes WARNING messages.                                                                       |
| INFO           | Includes informational messages about server activity.                                           |
| CONFIG         | Includes messages about configuration changes.                                                   |
| FINE           | This is the default; provides detailed information about server activity.                        |
| FINER          | Includes a higher level of detail about server activity.                                         |
| FINEST         | Provides the highest level of detail about server activity.                                      |

After modifying the properties file, restart the server to make the changes take effect:

> `sudo systemctl restart tomcat`

## Upgrading the Console

The steps that follow provide detailed instructions about upgrading the Ark console. Before upgrading the console, you must ensure that no users are connected to the console, and that there are no cluster operations (backup, cloning, etc) in progress; you may wish to alert users to the pending upgrade with a wall message.

Use the `Show logged in users` button on the Admin tab to confirm that no users are connected to the console, and check the server log (located in `/var/log/edb-ark/ark.log`) to confirm that all server activities have completed. Then:

1.  Use ssh to connect to the node on which the Ark console resides, and assume root privileges:
    
    `sudo su -`

2.  With your choice of editor, modify the repository configuration file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`), enabling the `edb-ark` repository URL.

<!-- end list -->

``` text
[edb-ark]
name=EnterpriseDB EDB Ark
baseurl=http://<username>:<username>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-ark/redhat/rhel-\\$releasever-\\$basearch
enabled=0
gpgcheck=0
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

To enable the repository, replace the `<username>` and `<username>` placeholders with your user name and password, and set enabled to `1`.

3.  Use the `yum list edb-ark` command to review a list of available updates.
    
    `yum list edb-ark`

4.  If any updates are available, use yum to install the updates:
    
    `yum update package_ name`
    
    Where `package_name` specifies the name of the package that you wish to update.

5.  When the downloads complete, navigate into the `/usr/share/tomcat/` directory:
    
    `cd /usr/share/tomcat`

6.  Invoke the EDB Ark post-installation script to upgrade the console:
    
    `./postInstall.sh`
    
    The installation script will prompt you to confirm that the console is not in use, and that you wish to continue with the installation.

<!-- end list -->

``` text
[root@ip-172-31-15-135 yum.repos.d]# /usr/share/tomcat/postInstall.sh 
Script will upgrade the application! Is the EDB-ARK console in a steady state (no logged in users, no activity in the console)?
Are you sure you want to continue? <y/N> y
Updating EDB-ARK Application...
Stopping httpd and tomcat services...
Deploying the latest application in tomcat
Starting httpd and tomcat services...
Done!
```

When the `yum update` completes, navigate to the Ark URL in your browser, and enter the account password. You will be taken to the Ark deployment dialog where you will be required to provide the `Service Account ID` and `Service Account Password`; provide any missing values, select a `Time Zone`, and restart the Ark server. Ark will open to the `Login` dialog.

## Updating a PEM Installation

If you are using a local installation of PEM to monitor an Ark console, you may want to update your version of PEM to a more recent version. To update your PEM installation:

1.  Ensure that the `edb-ark.repo` file is enabled and contains your connection credentials:
    
    Use ssh to connect to the Ark console host, and navigate to the `/etc/yum.repos.d` directory. Then, use your choice of editor to update the `edb-ark.repo` file.

<!-- end list -->

``` bash
[edb-ark]
name=EnterpriseDB EDB-ARK $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-ark/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=0
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
[edb-tools]
name=EnterpriseDB Tools $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/tools/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=0
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
[edb-dependencies]
name=EnterpriseDB Dependencies $releasever-$basearchbaseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/dependencies/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=0
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

Modify the repository details, replacing each `<username>` and `<password>` placeholder with your credentials for the EnterpriseDB repository, and setting enabled to `1`. To request credentials for the repository, please visit the [EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/advanced-downloads).

2.  Assume superuser privileges.
    
    `sudo su`

3.  Use yum to update the PEM agent and PEM server version installed on your Ark console host:
    
    `yum install edb-pem-python-idna.noarch`
    
    `yum update edb-pem edb-pem-server`

4.  When the installation completes, configure the updated PEM server:
    
    `/usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh -dbi /usr/pgsql-10 -d /var/lib/pgsql/10/data/ -ho 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -su postgres -sp <ark_console_password> -t 1 -ci 0.0.0.0/0 -ds postgresql-10 -acp ~/.pem/`
    
    Where `<ark_console_password>` is the password of the Ark console.
    
    For more information about using PEM, please see the [PEM user guides](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/product-documentation).

## Recovering From a Console Failure

User and instance information used by the Ark console is stored in tables in a Postgres database. If the console application should fail, the information will persist in the console database, and will be available when the console application restarts.

If the system hosting the application database fails, then all information about the console database and registered users will be lost unless you have retained a backup.

The Ark console is configured to take automatic backups of the console database hourly, and after the registration of each new user. If you do not wish to use the Ark backup script to implement backups, you should maintain regular backups of your console database.

Please note: the Ark recovery utility only supports recovering the console from a backup that is the same version as the current console version.

## Modifying Backup Properties with the EDB Ark Console

You can use the `Installation Properties` dialog to modify console backup properties; to modify the properties, navigate to the Admin tab, and click the Edit Installation Properties button.

![Console management](images/ark_console_mgmt_modify_backup_props.png)

When the `Edit Installation Properties` dialog opens, you can modify details about the console backup storage:

  - Use the `Backup Script` field to specify the name and location of the backup script provided with EDB Ark. If you choose to provide your own backup script, use the parameter to specify the name and location.

  - Use the `DB Name` field to specify the name of the console database; the default is `postgres`.

  - Use the `Directory to Store Backups` field to specify a directory to which backups will be written. Please note that you must create the directory specified.
    
    The backup directory specified should not reside on the console VM's root disk; your backup would be lost in the event of a VM failure. You should consider mounting an external volume to the console VM, and writing console database backups to that volume.

  - Use the `DB User Name` field to specify the name of the console database user; the default is postgres.

  - Use the `DB User Password` field to specify the password associated with the console database user; the default password is:
    
    <span class="title-ref">0f42d1934a1a19f3d25d6288f2a3272c6143fc5d</span>

  - Use the `Storage Bucket` field to specify the name of the swift storage container that will be used to store files for point-in-time recovery. This location should not change after the initial deployment of the Ark console.

  - Use the `Console Backup Folder` field to specify a folder in which the backups will be stored.

  - Use the `Storage Tenant` field to provide the name of the tenant in which the backup will be stored.

## Using the Recover Option

If the console cannot locate a registered user, and your console is configured to support console backups, the Ark console login dialog will request the password specified during setup and display the `Deploy Console` or `Recover from Backup` options when you navigate to the console address.

![*The connection dialog*](images/ark_console_mgmt_recover.png)

To initiate a console recovery, provide the console password specified when you deployed the console instance (in the Amazon management console), and click the Recover from Backup button. The console properties dialog opens, prompting you for information about console backups.

Use the dialog to provide details about the console, and the location of a backup to recover. When you're finished, click the Recover button to start the recovery process. A popup will open, prompting you for the name of the backup folder that you wish to use for the recovery.

Use the `Folder name` drop-down listbox to select the backup you wish to use for the recovery, and click `Finish` to start the recovery process. If your system is monitored by a local PEM server, the backup will attempt to restore both the Ark and PEM servers.

## Manually Recovering from Console Backups

If you wish to manually save backups, you can use the Postgres [pg_dump](http://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/en/9.6/pg/app-pgdump.html) or [pg_dumpall](http://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/en/9.6/pg/app-pg-dumpall.html) command to archive the console database. Then, you can then use the [pg_restore](http://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/en/9.6/pg/app-pgrestore.html) command to restore the console database if necessary.

**Recovering the Console with a Backup Script**

The backup script provided with the Ark console uses pg_dump to create a plain-text SQL script file that contains the commands required to rebuild the console database to the state in which the backup was taken. After using ssh to connect to the host of the console, you can use the following command to invoke the psql command line tool and restore the console:

    /usr/bin/psql –h localhost –p 5432 –d postgres –U postgres -f <(echo truncate sequence\\;; cat ``recovery_file``

Where `recovery_file` specifies the path and name of the backup file you wish to restore.

While restoring a console instance, you should shut down the application server so that the console application isn't actively using the database. When the restoration is complete, restart the application server.

title: "Securing EDB Postgres Ark"
---

<div id="ark_securing_ark" class="registered_link"></div>


Each cluster has an associated security group that specifies the addresses from which the cluster will accept connections. By default, the security group exposes only port <span class="title-ref">9999</span> (the load balancing port) to the outside world, while allowing inter-cluster communication, and console-to-cluster communication between the servers in the cluster.

You can modify the security group, strategically exposing other ports for client connection. For example, you may wish to open port `22` to allow ssh connections to a server, or port `5444` to allow connections to the listener port of the Advanced Server database server that resides on a replica node.

EDB Ark assigns the same security group to every member of a cluster. By default, the security group contains rules that specify that any cluster member may connect to any other member's ICMP port, TCP port or UDP port. These rules do not permit connections from hosts on the public Internet. You *must not* alter these security rules.

Additional rules open TCP ports `7800-7802` to the cluster manager, allowing the cluster manager to perform maintenance and administrative tasks. Please note that the rules governing connections from the cluster manager *must* remain open to allow:

  - intra-cluster communications
  - communication with the console or cluster manager
  - maintenance and administrative functionality

The rule for TCP port `9999` uses a CIDR mask (`0.0.0.0/0`) to specify that port `9999` is open for connections from any IP address. You can customize this rule, selectively restricting the IP addresses from which computers are allowed to connect to a given port within the cluster.

Please note that EDB Ark provides a secure environment for all communications within the cluster, and between the cluster and the the console or cluster manager by employing SSH authentication and SSL encryption.

<div class="index">

Security Group, Modifying

</div>

## Modifying a Security Group for an Amazon AWS Hosted Console

Security groups for Ark clusters that reside on an AWS host are managed through the Amazon management console; Amazon administrative privileges are required to review or modify the security group entries.

To manage a security group for a cluster, connect to the AWS management console, and locate the cluster on the Instances dashboard. Highlight the cluster name, and scroll through the columns to the right. Click the name of the security group (in the Security Groups column) to review detailed information about the rules that are currently defined for the cluster.

To modify a security group and add a rule that allows connections from an outside client (such as ssh), navigate to the Inbound tab, and click the Edit button. When the Edit inbound rules dialog opens, click the Add Rule button to add a new line to the list of rules.

![Editing the inbound rules](images/ark_securing_ark_editing_inbound_rules.png)

Specify the rule type, the protocol type, the port (or port range) on which inbound connections will be accepted, and the CIDR-formatted address from which you will be connecting.

Consult the core documentation for more information about specifying a [CIDR address](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/datatype-net-types.html).

When you've defined the rule, click Save to add the entry to the inbound rules list.

Please consult the [Amazon documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html) for detailed information about managing the security group for a virtual private cloud.

<div class="index">

SSH Connections

</div>

## Using ssh to Access a Server

EDB Ark creates an ssh key when you create a new cluster; each cluster has a unique key. Before connecting to a Postgres instance that resides on the cloud via an ssh encrypted connection, you must download the ssh key, and adjust the privileges on the key file.

To download your private key, navigate to the Clusters tab, and click the Download SSH Key icon. The Accessing Your Cluster Instance popup opens.

![Using SSH](images/ark_securing_ark_using_ssl.png)

The popup displays the tenant name, the cluster name, the name that you should use when connecting to the cluster, and the IP address to which you should connect.

Before using the private key, you must modify the permissions on the keyfile. Use the following command to restrict file permissions:

> `chmod 0600 <ssh_key_file>.pem`

Where \<ssh_key_file\>.pem specifies the complete path and name of the EDB Ark ssh private key file.

After modifying the key file permissions, you can use ssh to connect to the cluster. Include the complete path to the key file when invoking the command provided on the Accessing Your Cluster Instance popup.

Please note: Postgres Server applications must be invoked by the Postgres cluster owner (identified when creating an EDB Ark cluster as the Master User). If you are using a PostgreSQL server, the default user name is postgres; if you are using Advanced Server, the default user name is enterprisedb. To change your identity after connecting via ssh, use the su command:

> `# sudo su database_user_name`

<div class="index">

iptables Rules

</div>

## Using iptables Rules

If you are using iptables rules to manage security on the host of the Ark console, please note that you must not modify the iptables rules provided by EDB Ark.

If you are using iptables on the host of the Ark console, do not modify the following rules:

> `iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 –j REDIRECT --to-port 8080`
> 
> `iptables -A PREROUTING -t nat -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 –j REDIRECT --to-port 8181`
> 
> `iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 8181 -j ACCEPT`
> 
> `iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT`

These rules:

  - redirect http and https traffic on ports `80` and `443` to the default ports (`8080` and `8181`).
  - allow inbound traffic on `8080` and `8181`.
  - save the configuration (to preserve the behaviors when the system reboots).

If you are using iptables on an Advanced Server cluster, do not modify the following rules:

> `iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 7800:7802 -j ACCEPT`
> 
> `iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 5444 -j ACCEPT`
> 
> `iptables –I INPUT 1 –p tcp --dport 9999 –j ACCEPT`

If you are using iptables on a PostgreSQL cluster, do not modify the following rules:

> `iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 7800:7802 -j ACCEPT`
> 
> `iptables -I INPUT 1 -p tcp --dport 5432 -j ACCEPT`
> 
> `iptables –I INPUT 1 –p tcp --dport 9999 –j ACCEPT`

The rules:

  - allow inbound traffic from the Ark console on ports `7800` and `7802`.
  - allow inbound traffic on the database listener ports.
  - save the configuration (to preserve the behaviors when the system reboots).
  - allow inbound traffic on the load balancer port.

## Post-Installation Recommendations

**SE Linux**

During the installation process, SE Linux is disabled on the console host. Please note that SE Linux must remain disabled for the Ark console and clusters to function properly.

**Create a Secondary User Account**

The Ark console installation process creates an administrative user (named `centos` on CentOS hosts, or `cloud-user` on RHEL hosts) with ssh access to the console host. After installing the Ark console, you should use ssh to connect to the console host, and create a secondary user account that can be used to login and gain `root` privileges in the event that the installer-created user should lose ssh access for any reason.
---
title: "Creating a Statically Provisioned Image"
---

<div id="ark_statically_provisioned" class="registered_link"></div>


An `install.sh` script is distributed with Ark; use the script when creating a statically provisioned image. If you are creating a statically provisioned image on a RHEL host, you must register the host before configuring the cluster.

1.  Create an instance that contains the backing operating system for your image.

2.  Use `scp` to copy the <span class="title-ref">install.sh</span> file to the instance.

3.  Use the following command to modify the permissions associated with the <span class="title-ref">install.sh</span> file:
    
        ``chmod a+x install.sh``

4.  Then, assume superuser privileges and invoke the install.sh script, including command options and values that specify details about the image:

| Option | Value                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| \-n    | The database server type                                                                                                                                                         |
| \-v    | The database server version                                                                                                                                                      |
| \-u    | If true, Ark will invoke the yum update command and update the currently installed software packages.                                                                            |
| \-c    | When set to true, the script will configure and enable required RHEL repositories.                                                                                               |
| \-r    | The repository address (and if applicable, credentials) for provisioning. Include the -r flag once for each repository required by packages specified with the -p or -o options. |
| \-p    | A list of the packages that will be installed in the image.                                                                                                                      |
| \-o    | A list of additional packages that should be installed in the image.                                                                                                             |

5.  Take a snapshot of the instance, and make the image public to make it accessible to the Ark console.

**Examples**

For example, the following command creates a static image that contains the EDB Postgres Advanced Server 10 database on a RHEL host:

> `$ sudo ./install.sh -n ppas -v 10 -u true -c true -r http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@yum.enterprisedb.com/10/redhat/rhel-\$releasever-\$basearch -r http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@yum.enterprisedb.com/tools/redhat/rhel-\$releasever-\$basearch -r http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@yum.enterprisedb.com/dependencies/redhat/rhel-\$releasever-\$basearch -p edb-as10-server edb-pgpool35 edb-as10-pgpool35-extensions`

The following command creates a static image that contains PostgreSQL 10 on a CentOS host:

EDB Ark will send e-mail notifications when:

  - The state of a monitored database cluster changes.
  - An administrative action is performed on a cluster
  - User information changes.

Please note: For EDB Ark notifications to function properly, you must have an SMTP server running on each node, and provide contact email addresses for the Ark administrator and Ark user.

  - EDB designs, establishes coding best practices, reviews, and verifies input validation for the logon UI for EDB Postgres Ark where present. EDB follows the same approach for additional input components, however the nature of the product may require that it accepts freeform SQL, WMI or other strings to be entered and submitted by trusted users for which limited validation is possible. In such cases it is not possible to prevent users from entering incorrect or otherwise dangerous inputs.
  - EDB reserves the right to add features to products that accept freeform SQL, WMI or other potentially dangerous inputs from authenticated, trusted users in the future, but will ensure all such features are designed and tested to ensure they provide the minimum possible risk, and where possible, require superuser or equivalent privileges.
  - EDB does not that warrant that we can or will anticipate all potential threats and therefore our process cannot fully guarantee that all potential vulnerabilities have been addressed or considered.
