title: Building the toolkit.properties File
---


Migration Toolkit uses the configuration and connection information stored in the toolkit.properties file during the migration process to identify and connect to the source and target databases. On Linux, the toolkit.properties file is located in:

> /opt/PostgresPlus/edbmtk/etc

On Windows, the file is located in:

> C:\\Program Files\\PostgresPlus\\edbmtk\\etc

A sample toolkit.properties file is shown in Figure 5.1.

Figure 5.1 - A typical toolkit.properties file.

Before executing Migration Toolkit commands, modify the toolkit.properties file with the editor of your choice. Update the file to include the following information:
 - SRC\_DB\_URL specifies how Migration Toolkit should connect to the source database. See the section corresponding to your source database for details about forming the URL.
 - SRC\_DB\_USER specifies a user name (with sufficient privileges) in the source database.
 - SRC\_DB\_PASSWORD specifies the password of the source database user.
 - TARGET\_DB\_URL specifies the JDBC URL of the target database.
 - TARGET\_DB\_USER specifies the name of a privileged target database user.
 - TARGET\_DB\_PASSWORD specifies the password of the target database user.

## Defining an Advanced Server URL

Migration Toolkit facilitates migration from the following platforms to Advanced Server:
 - Oracle
 - MySQL
 - Sybase
 - SQL Server
 - PostgreSQL

For a definitive list of the objects migrated from each database type, please refer to [Section 3](#functionality-overview), *Functionality* *Overview*.

Migration Toolkit reads connection specifications for the source and the target database from the toolkit.properties file. Connection information for each must include:
 - The URL of the database
 - The name of a privileged user
 - The password associated with the specified user.

The URL conforms to JDBC standards and takes the form:

{TARGET\_DB\_URL|SRC\_DB\_URL}=jdbc:edb://*host*:*port*/*database\_id*

An Advanced Server URL contains the following information:

jdbc

> The protocol is always jdbc.

edb

> If you are using Advanced Server, specify edb for the sub-protocol value.

*host*

> The name or IP address of the host where the Postgres instance is running.

*port*

> The port number that the Advanced Server database listener is monitoring. The default port number is 5444.

*database\_id*

> The name of the source or target database.

{TARGET\_DB\_USER|SRC\_DB\_USER} must specify a user with privileges to CREATE each type of object migrated. If migrating data into a table, the specified user may also require INSERT, TRUNCATE and REFERENCES privileges for each target table.

{TARGET\_DB\_PASSWORD|SRC\_DB\_PASSWORD} is set to the password of the privileged Advanced Server user.

## Defining a PostgreSQL URL

Migration Toolkit facilitates migration from the following platforms to PostgreSQL:
 - Oracle
 - MySQL
 - SQL Server
 - Postgres Plus Advanced Server

For a definitive list of the objects migrated from each database type, please refer to [Section 3](#functionality-overview), *Functionality* *Overview*.

Migration Toolkit reads connection specifications for the source and the target database from the toolkit.properties file. Connection information for each must include:
 - The URL of the database
 - The name of a privileged user
 - The password associated with the specified user.

A PostgreSQL URL conforms to JDBC standards and takes the form:

{SRC\_DB\_URL|TARGET\_DB\_URL}=jdbc:postgresql://*host*:*port*/*database\_id*

The URL contains the following information:

jdbc

> The protocol is always jdbc.

postgresql

> If you are using PostgreSQL, specify postgresql for the sub-protocol value.

*host*

> The name or IP address of the host where the Postgres instance is running.

*port*

> The port number that the Postgres database listener is monitoring. The default port number is 5432.

*database\_id*

> The name of the source or target database.

{SRC\_DB\_USER|TARGET\_DB\_USER}must specify a user with privileges to CREATE each type of object migrated. If migrating data into a table, the specified user may also require INSERT, TRUNCATE and REFERENCES privileges for each target table.

{SRC\_DB\_PASSWORD|TARGET\_DB\_PASSWORD}is set to the password of the privileged PostgreSQL user.

## Defining an Oracle URL

Migration Toolkit facilitates migration from an Oracle database to a PostgreSQL or Advanced Server database. When migrating from Oracle, you must specify connection specifications for the Oracle source database in the toolkit.properties file. The connection information must include:
 - The URL of the Oracle database
 - The name of a privileged user
 - The password associated with the specified user.

When migrating from an Oracle database, SRC\_DB\_URL should contain a JDBC URL, specified in one of two forms. The first form is:

> jdbc:oracle:thin:@*host\_name*:*port*:*database\_id*

The second form is:

> jdbc:oracle:thin:@//*host\_name*:*port*/{*database\_id*|*service\_name*}

An Oracle URL contains the following information:

jdbc

> The protocol is always jdbc.

oracle

> The sub-protocol is always oracle.

thin

> The driver type. Specify a driver type of thin.

*host\_name*

> The name or IP address of the host where the Oracle server is running.

*port*

> The port number that the Oracle database listener is monitoring.

*database\_id*

> The database SID of the Oracle database.

*service\_name*

> The name of the Oracle service.

SRC\_DB\_USER should specify the name of a privileged Oracle user.

SRC\_DB\_PASSWORD must contain the password of the specified user.

## Defining a MySQL URL

Migration Toolkit facilitates migration from a MySQL database to an Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database. When migrating from MySQL, you must specify connection specifications for the MySQL source database in the toolkit.properties file. The connection information must include:
 - The URL of the source database
 - The name of a privileged user
 - The password associated with the specified user.

When migrating from MySQL, SRC\_DB\_URL takes the form of a JDBC URL. For example:

> jdbc:mysql://*host\_name*\[:*port*\]/*database\_id*

A MySQL URL contains the following information:

jdbc

> The protocol is always jdbc.

mysql

> The sub-protocol is always mysql.

*//host\_name*

> The name or IP address of the host where the source server is running.

\[*port*\]

> The port number that the MySQL database listener is monitoring.

*/database\_id*

> The name of the source database.

SRC\_DB\_USER should specify the name of a privileged MySQL user.

SRC\_DB\_PASSWORD must contain the password of the specified user.

## Defining a Sybase URL

Migration Toolkit facilitates migration from a Sybase database to an Advanced Server database. When migrating from Sybase, you must specify connection specifications for the Sybase source database in the toolkit.properties file. The connection information must include:
 - The URL of the source database
 - The name of a privileged user
 - The password associated with the specified user.

When migrating from Sybase, SRC\_DB\_URL takes the form of a JTDS URL. For example:

> jdbc:jtds:sybase://*host\_name*\[:*port*\]/*database\_id*

A Sybase URL contains the following information:

jdbc

> The protocol is always jdbc.

jtds

> The driver name is always jtds.

sybase

> The server type is always sybase.

*host\_name*

> The name or IP address of the host where the source server is running.

*port*

> The port number that the Sybase database listener is monitoring.

*database\_id*

The name of the source database.

SRC\_DB\_USER should specify the name of a privileged Sybase user.

SRC\_DB\_PASSWORD must contain the password of the specified user.

## Defining a SQL Server URL

Migration Toolkit facilitates migration from a SQL Server database to a PostgreSQL or Advanced Server database. Migration Toolkit supports migration of the following object definitions:
 - schemas
 - tables
 - table data
 - constraints
 - indexes

Migration Toolkit reads connection specifications for the source database from the toolkit.properties file. The connection information must include:
 - The URL of the source database
 - The name of a privileged user
 - The password associated with the specified user.

If you are connecting to a SQL Server database, SRC\_DB\_URL takes the form of a JTDS URL. For example:

> jdbc:jtds:sqlserver://*server*\[:*port*\]/*database\_id*

A SQL Server URL contains the following information:

jdbc

> The protocol is always jdbc.

jtds

> The driver name is always jtds.

sqlserver

> The server type is always sqlserver.
