navTitle: Migration Toolkit
---

Migration Toolkit is a powerful command-line tool that offers granular control of the migration process. Migration Toolkit facilitates migration of database objects and data to an Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database from:
 - Oracle
 - MySQL
 - SQL Server

You can also use Migration Toolkit to migrate database objects and data from Sybase to Advanced Server, or between Advanced Server and PostgreSQL.

You can install Migration Toolkit with the Postgres Plus Advanced Server installer, or via Stack Builder. Stack Builder is distributed with both Advanced Server, and the PostgreSQL one-click installer available from the EnterpriseDB web site at:

<http://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads>

This guide provides a high-level description of the steps involved in the migration process, as well as installation and usage instructions for Migration Toolkit. It also includes solutions to common migration problems, and details unsupported features and their potential workarounds.

**Please Note:**

This guide uses the term Postgres to refer to *either* an installation of Postgres Plus Advanced Server or PostgreSQL.

This guide uses the term Stack Builder to refer to *either* StackBuilder Plus (distributed with Postgres Plus Advanced Server) or Stack Builder (distributed with the PostgreSQL one-click installer from EnterpriseDB).

EnterpriseDB does not support the use of Migration Toolkit with Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) and Oracle Exadata; the aforementioned Oracle products have not been evaluated nor certified with this EnterpriseDB product.

## What’s New

The following features have been added to the Migration Toolkit version 9.3 to create the Migration Toolkit version 9.4:
 - Migration Toolkit now prevents usage with a non-secure toolkit.properties file. For more information, see [Section 6](#executing-migration-toolkit).
 - Migration Toolkit now supports migration of Postgres materialized views with the -allViews and -views options as well as in its default migration behavior (for example, importing the entire schema). For more information, see [Section 7.4](#_Schema_Object_Selection).
 - Migration Toolkit now supports the –useOraCase option to preserve the Oracle default, uppercase naming convention. For more information, see [Section 7.6](#_Oracle_Specific_Options).
 - Migration Toolkit now supports the -logBadSQL option to save the DDL statements of database objects for which migration failed. For more information, see [Section 7.7](#_Miscellaneous_Options).
 - Migration Toolkit now generates summary information including a count of database objects that are not migrated due to warnings and errors. For more information, see [Section 7.8](#_Example).
 - Migration Toolkit now displays error codes for error and warning messages. For more information, see [Section 9](#error-codes).

## Typographical Conventions Used in this Guide

Certain typographical conventions are used in this manual to clarify the meaning and usage of various commands, statements, programs, examples, etc. This section provides a summary of these conventions.

In the following descriptions a *term* refers to any word or group of words that are language keywords, user-supplied values, literals, etc. A term’s exact meaning depends upon the context in which it is used.
 - *Italic font* introduces a new term, typically, in the sentence that defines it for the first time.
 - Fixed-width (mono-spaced) font is used for terms that must be given literally such as SQL commands, specific table and column names used in the examples, programming language keywords, etc. For example, SELECT \* FROM emp;
 - *Italic fixed-width font* is used for terms for which the user must substitute values in actual usage. For example, DELETE FROM *table\_name*;
 - A vertical pipe | denotes a choice between the terms on either side of the pipe. A vertical pipe is used to separate two or more alternative terms within square brackets (optional choices) or braces (one mandatory choice).
 - Square brackets \[ \] denote that one or none of the enclosed term(s) may be substituted. For example, \[ a | b \], means choose one of “a” or “b” or neither of the two.
 - Braces {} denote that exactly one of the enclosed alternatives must be specified. For example, { a | b }, means exactly one of “a” or “b” must be specified.
 - Ellipses ... denote that the proceeding term may be repeated. For example, \[ a | b \] ... means that you may have the sequence, “b a a b a”.
