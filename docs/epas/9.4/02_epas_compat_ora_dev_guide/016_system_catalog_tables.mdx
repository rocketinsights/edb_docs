title: System Catalog Tables
---


The following system catalog tables contain definitions of database objects. The layout of the system tables is subject to change; if you are writing an application that depends on information stored in the system tables, it would be prudent to use an existing catalog view, or create a catalog view to isolate the application from changes to the system table.

### edb\_dir

The edb\_dir table contains one row for each alias that points to a directory created with the create directory command. A directory is an alias for a pathname that allows a user limited access to the host file system.

You can use a directory to fence a user into a specific directory tree within the file system. For example, the UTL\_FILE package offers functions that permit a user to read and write files and directories in the host file system, but only allows access to paths that the database administrator has granted access to via a create directory command.

| Column   | Type        | Modifiers | Description                                                               |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dirname  | "name"      | not null  | The name of the alias.                                                    |
| dirowner | oid         | not null  | The OID of the user that owns the alias.                                  |
| dirpath  | text        |           | The directory name to which access is granted.                            |
| diracl   | aclitem\[\] |           | The access control list that determines which users may access the alias. |

### edb\_variable

The edb\_variable table contains one row for each package level variable (each variable declared within a package).

### pg\_synonym

The pg\_synonym table contains one row for each synonym created with the CREATE SYNONYM command or CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM command.

| synlink      | text   |           | The (optional) name of the database link in which the referenced object is defined.      |

### product\_component\_version

The product\_component\_version table contains information about feature compatibility; an application can query this table at installation or run time to verify that features used by the application are available with this deployment.

| Column  | Type                   | Description                        |
