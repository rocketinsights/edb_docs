title: Advanced Server JDBC Connector Overview
---


Sun Microsystems created a standardized interface for connecting Java applications to databases known as Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). The Postgres Plus Advanced Server JDBC Connector connects a Java application to a Postgres database.

## JDBC Driver Types

There are currently four different types of JDBC drivers, each with it’s own specific implementation, use and limitations. The Advanced Server JDBC Connector is a Type 4 driver.

Type 1 Driver
 - This driver type is the JDBC-ODBC bridge.
 - It is limited to running locally.
 - Must have ODBC installed on computer.
 - Must have ODBC driver for specific database installed on computer.
 - Generally can’t run inside an applet because of Native Method calls.

Type 2 Driver
 - This is the native database library driver.
 - Uses Native Database library on computer to access database.
 - Generally can’t run inside an applet because of Native Method calls.
 - Must have database library installed on client.

Type 3 Driver
 - 100% Java Driver, no native methods.
 - Does not require pre-installation on client.
 - Can be downloaded and configured on-the-fly just like any Java class file.
 - Uses a proprietary protocol for talking with a middleware server.
 - Middleware server converts from proprietary calls to DBMS specific calls

Type 4 Driver
 - 100% Java Driver, no native methods.
 - Does not require pre-installation on client.
 - Can be downloaded and configured on-the-fly just like any Java class file.
 - Unlike Type III driver, talks directly with the DBMS server.
 - Converts JDBC calls directly to database specific calls.

## The JDBC Interface

Figure 2.1 shows the core API interfaces in the JDBC specification and how they relate to each other. These interfaces are implemented in the java.sql package.

## JDBC Classes and Interfaces

The core API is composed of classes and interfaces; these classes and interfaces work together as shown in Figure 2.2:

## The JDBC DriverManager

Figure 2.3 depicts the role of the DriverManager class in a typical JDBC application. The DriverManager acts as the bridge between a Java application and the backend database and determines which JDBC driver to use for the target database.
