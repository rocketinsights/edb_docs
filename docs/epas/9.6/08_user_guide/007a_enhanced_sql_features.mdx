Advanced Server includes enhanced SQL functionality that provides additional flexibility and convenience. This chapter discusses some of these additions.

## COMMENT

In addition to commenting on objects supported by the PostgreSQL COMMENT command, Advanced Server supports comments on additional object types. The complete supported syntax is:

COMMENT ON
{
AGGREGATE *aggregate*\_*name* ( *aggregate*\_*signature* ) |
CAST (*source*\_*type* AS *target*\_*type*) |
COLLATION *object*\_*name* |
COLUMN *relation*\_*name*.*column*\_*name* |
CONSTRAINT *constraint*\_*name* ON *table*\_*name* |
CONSTRAINT *constraint*\_*name* ON DOMAIN *domain*\_*name* |
CONVERSION *object*\_*name* |
DATABASE *object*\_*name* |
DOMAIN *object*\_*name* |
EXTENSION *object*\_*name* |
EVENT TRIGGER *object*\_*name* |
FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER *object*\_*name* |
FOREIGN TABLE *object*\_*name* |
FUNCTION *func*\_*name* (\[\[*argmode*\] \[*argname*\] *argtype* \[, ...\]\])|
INDEX *object*\_*name* |
LARGE OBJECT *large*\_*object*\_*oid* |
MATERIALIZED VIEW *object*\_*name* |
OPERATOR *operator*\_*name* (left\_type, right\_type) |
OPERATOR CLASS *object*\_*name* USING *index*\_*method* |
OPERATOR FAMILY *object*\_*name* USING *index*\_*method* |
PACKAGE *object*\_*name*
POLICY *policy*\_*name* ON *table*\_*name* |
\[ PROCEDURAL \] LANGUAGE *object*\_*name* |
PROCEDURE *proc*\_*name* \[(\[\[*argmode*\] \[*argname*\] *argtype* \[, ...\]\])\]
PUBLIC SYNONYM *object*\_*name*
ROLE *object*\_*name* |
RULE *rule*\_*name* ON *table*\_*name* |
SCHEMA *object*\_*name* |
SEQUENCE *object*\_*name* |
SERVER *object*\_*name* |
TABLE *object*\_*name* |
TABLESPACE *object*\_*name* |
TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION *object*\_*name* |
TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY *object*\_*name* |
TEXT SEARCH PARSER *object*\_*name* |
TEXT SEARCH TEMPLATE *object*\_*name* |
TRANSFORM FOR *type*\_*name* LANGUAGE *lang*\_*name* |
TRIGGER *trigger*\_*name* ON *table*\_*name* |
TYPE *object*\_*name* |
VIEW *object*\_*name*
} IS *'text'*

where *aggregate*\_*signature* is:

\* |
\[ *argmode* \] \[ *argname* \] *argtype* \[ , ... \] |
\[ \[ *argmode* \] \[ *argname* \] *argtype* \[ , ... \] \]
ORDER BY \[ *argmode* \] \[ *argname* \] *argtype* \[ , ... \]

**Parameters**

*object\_name*

> The name of the object on which you are commenting.

AGGREGATE *aggregate*\_*name* (*aggregate*\_*signature*)

> Include the AGGREGATE clause to create a comment about an aggregate. *aggregate*\_*name* specifies the name of an aggregate, and *aggregate*\_*signature* specifies the associated signature in one of the following forms:
>
> \* |
> \[ *argmode* \] \[ *argname* \] *argtype* \[ , ... \] |
> \[ \[ *argmode* \] \[ *argname* \] *argtype* \[ , ... \] \]
> ORDER BY \[ *argmode* \] \[ *argname* \] *argtype* \[ , ... \]
>
> Where *argmode* is the mode of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument; argmode may be IN, OUT, INOUT, or VARIADIC. If omitted, the default is IN.
>
> *argname* is the name of an aggregate argument.
>
> *argtype* is the data type of an aggregate argument.

CAST (*source*\_*type* AS *target*\_*type*)

> Include the CAST clause to create a comment about a cast. When creating a comment about a cast, *source\_type* specifies the source data type of the cast, and *target\_type* specifies the target data type of the cast.

COLUMN *relation*\_*name*.*column*\_*name*

> Include the COLUMN clause to create a comment about a column. *column\_name* specifies name of the column to which the comment applies. *relation\_name* is the table, view, composite type, or foreign table in which a column resides.

CONSTRAINT *constraint*\_*name* ON *table*\_*name*
CONSTRAINT *constraint*\_*name* ON DOMAIN *domain*\_*name*

> Include the CONSTRAINT clause to add a comment about a constraint. When creating a comment about a constraint, *constraint\_name* specifies the name of the constraint; *table\_name* or *domain\_name* specifies the name of the table or domain on which the constraint is defined.

FUNCTION *func*\_*name* (\[\[*argmode*\] \[*argname*\] *argtype* \[, ...\]\])

> Include the FUNCTION clause to add a comment about a function. *func*\_*name* specifies the name of the function. *argmode* specifies the mode of the function; *argmode* may be IN, OUT, INOUT, or VARIADIC. If omitted, the default is IN. *argname* specifies the name of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument. *argtype* specifies the data type of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument.

*large\_object\_oid*

> *large\_object\_oid* is the system-assigned OID of the large object about which you are commenting.

OPERATOR *operator*\_*name* (left\_type, right\_type)

> Include the OPERATOR clause to add a comment about an operator. *operator*\_*name* specifies the (optionally schema-qualified) name of an operator on which you are commenting. *left*\_*type* and *right*\_*type* are the (optionally schema-qualified) data type(s) of the operator's arguments.

OPERATOR CLASS *object*\_*name* USING *index*\_*method*

> Include the OPERATOR CLASS clause to add a comment about an operator class. *object*\_*name* specifies the (optionally schema-qualified) name of an operator on which you are commenting. *index\_method* specifies the associated index method of the operator class.

OPERATOR FAMILY *object*\_*name* USING *index*\_*method*

> Include the OPERATOR FAMILY clause to add a comment about an operator family. *object*\_*name* specifies the (optionally schema-qualified) name of an operator family on which you are commenting. *index\_method* specifies the associated index method of the operator family.

POLICY *policy*\_*name* ON *table*\_*name*

> Include the POLICY clause to add a comment about a policy. *policy*\_*name* specifies the name of the policy, and *table*\_*name* specifies the table that the policy is associated with.

PROCEDURE *proc*\_*name* \[(\[\[*argmode*\] \[*argname*\] *argtype* \[, ...\]\])\]

> Include the PROCEDURE clause to add a comment about a procedure. *proc*\_*name* specifies the name of the procedure. *argmode* specifies the mode of the procedure; *argmode* may be IN, OUT, INOUT, or VARIADIC. If omitted, the default is IN. *argname* specifies the name of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument. *argtype* specifies the data type of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument.

RULE *rule*\_*name* ON *table*\_*name*

> Include the RULE clause to specify a COMMENT on a rule. *rule*\_*name* specifies the name of the rule, and *table*\_*name* specifies the name of the table on which the rule is defined.

TRANSFORM FOR *type*\_*name* LANGUAGE *lang*\_*name* |

> Include the TRANSFORM FOR clause to specify a COMMENT on a TRANSFORM. *type*\_*name* specifies the name of the data type of the transform and *lang*\_*name* specifies the name of the language of the transform.

TRIGGER *trigger*\_*name* ON *table*\_*name*

> Include the TRIGGER clause to specify a COMMENT on a trigger. *trigger*\_*name* specifies the name of the trigger, and *table*\_*name* specifies the name of the table on which the trigger is defined.

*text*

> The comment, written as a string literal; or NULL to drop the comment.

**Notes:**

Names of tables, aggregates, collations, conversions, domains, foreign tables, functions, indexes, operators, operator classes, operator families, packages, procedures, sequences, text search objects, types, and views can be schema-qualified.

**Example:**

The following example adds a comment to a table named new\_emp:

COMMENT ON TABLE new\_emp IS 'This table contains information about new employees.';

For more information about using the COMMENT command, please see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:
