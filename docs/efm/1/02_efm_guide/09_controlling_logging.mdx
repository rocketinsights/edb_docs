Failover Manager writes and stores one log file per agent and one startup log per agent in `/var/log/<cluster_name>-3.9` (where `<cluster_name>` specifies the name of the cluster).

You can control the level of detail written to the agent log by modifying the `jgroups.loglevel` and `efm.loglevel` parameters in the [cluster properties file ](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/index#loglevel):

jgroups.loglevel=INFO
efm.loglevel=INFO
```

The logging facilities use the Java logging library and logging levels. The log levels (in order from most logging output to least) are:

>   - `TRACE`
>   - `DEBUG`
>   - `INFO`
>   - `WARN`
>   - `ERROR`

For example, if you set the `efm.loglevel` parameter to `WARN`, Failover Manager will only log messages at the `WARN` level and above (`WARN` and `ERROR`).

By default, Failover Manager log files are rotated daily, compressed, and stored for a week. You can modify the file rotation schedule by changing settings in the log rotation file (`/etc/logrotate.d/efm-3.9`). For more information about modifying the log rotation schedule, consult the logrotate man page:

> `$ man logrotate`

## Enabling syslog Log File Entries

Failover Manager supports for syslog logging. To implement syslog logging, you must configure syslog to allow UDP or TCP connections.

To allow a connection to syslog, edit the `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file and uncomment the protocol you wish to use. You must also ensure that the `UDPServerRun` or `TCPServerRun` entry associated with the protocol includes the port number to which log entries will be sent.

For example, the following configuration file entries enable UDP connections to port 514:

``` text
---
title: "Provides UDP syslog reception"
---

<div id="controlling_logging" class="registered_link"></div>

$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerRun 514
```

The following configuration file entries enable TCP connections to port 514:

``` text
---
title: "Provides TCP syslog reception"
---

<div id="controlling_logging" class="registered_link"></div>

$ModLoad imtcp
$InputTCPServerRun 514
```

After modifying the syslog configuration file, restart the rsyslog service to enable the connections:

> `systemctl restart rsyslog.service`

After modifying the `rsyslog.conf` file on the Failover Manager host, you must modify the Failover Manager properties to enable logging. Use your choice of editor to [modify the properties file ](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/index#logtype.enabled) (`/etc/edb/efm-3.9/efm.properties.in`) specifying the type of logging that you wish to implement:

``` text
---
title: "Which logging is enabled."
---

<div id="controlling_logging" class="registered_link"></div>

file.log.enabled=true
syslog.enabled=false
```

You must also [specify syslog details ](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/index#syslog.logging) for your system. Use the `syslog.protocol` parameter to specify the protocol type (UDP or TCP) and the `syslog.port` parameter to specify the listener port of the syslog host. The `syslog.facility` value may be used as an identifier for the process that created the entry; the value must be between LOCAL0 and LOCAL7.

``` text
---
title: "Syslog information. The syslog service must be listening on the"
---

<div id="controlling_logging" class="registered_link"></div>

 port for the given protocol, which can be UDP or
---
title: "TCP. The facilities supported are LOCAL0 through LOCAL7."
---

<div id="controlling_logging" class="registered_link"></div>

---
title: "syslog.host=localhost"
---

<div id="controlling_logging" class="registered_link"></div>

syslog.port=514
syslog.protocol=UDP
syslog.facility=LOCAL1
```

For more information about syslog, please see the syslog man page:

> `syslog man`
