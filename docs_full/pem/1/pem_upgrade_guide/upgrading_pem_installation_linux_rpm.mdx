The following sections will walk you through the upgrade process on a
Linux host, step-by-step.

Prerequisites:

If you are using a version of Postgres or Advanced Server that is lower
than version 10, then before the upgrade you need to install the libs
package of version 10 or above on the system where PEM server is
Installed. Use the following commands to install the libs version 10 or
above:

  -   - For Advanced Server:  
        `yum install edb-as<version>-server-libs`

  -   - For Postgres:  
        `yum install postgresql<version>-libs`

Where, *version* is the Postgres or Advanced Server version whose libs
package you want to install.

## Upgrading a PEM Agent that was installed using RPMs

You can use an RPM package to upgrade existing agents that were
initially installed by a package. The upgrade process does not update
the PEM agent configuration file. After installing the new agent, you
must manually copy the configuration file of the existing agent to the
new installation location.

To use RPM packages to upgrade a PEM agent, you must use the following
command:

> `yum upgrade edb-pem-agent`

If any lower version PEM Agent on CentOS 6.x that is registered with a
PEM server is upgraded to 7.10, you may see the following warning:

`warning: %postun(edb-pem-agent-7.9.0-3.rhel6.x86_64) scriptlet failed,
exit status 1`

`Non-fatal POSTUN scriptlet failure in rpm package edb-pem-agent`

In spite of the above warning, the upgrade gets successfully completed
and the agent is automatically restarted after upgrade.

If you have already configured or planning to configure any shell/batch
script run by a Linux agent that is upgraded from any lower version to
7.11 or later version, the user for the `batch_script_user` parameter
must be specified in the `agent.cfg` file. It is strongly recommended
that a non-root user is used to run the scripts. Using the root user may
result in compromising the data security and operating system security.
However, if you want to restore the pemagent to its original settings
using root user to run the scripts, then the `batch_script_user`
parameter value must be set to `root`.

## Upgrading the PEM Server that was installed using RPMs

If you have installed your PEM server with an RPM package, you can use
an RPM to upgrade your PEM server.

If you want to upgrade PEM server that is installed on a machine in
isolated network, you need to create PEM repository on that machine
before you upgrade the PEM server. For more information on creating PEM
repository in isolated network, see [Creating PEM repository in isolated
network](creating_pem_repository_in_isolated_network).

To use an RPM package to upgrade an existing RPM installation, you must:

1.  Use your package manager to upgrade the installed version of the PEM
    server:
    
    `yum upgrade edb-pem`

2.  Configure the upgraded server:
    
    `/usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh`

When invoking the configuration script, you can include command line
options to specify configuration properties; the script will prompt you
for values that you omit on the command line. The accepted options are:

If you do not provide configuration properties on the command line, you
will be prompted for values by the script. To view script-related help,
use the command:

> `/usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh --help`

If you are upgrading a 7.10 PEM Server on RHEL 6.x to PEM version 7.11,
you may see the following error text during the upgrade:

> `/var/tmp/rpm-tmp.<xxxxxx>: line 9: Requires:: command not found`

In spite of the above error, the upgrade gets completed successfully.

After executing the PEM server configuration file, use your
version-specific service control command to restart the `httpd` service.

For detailed information about using an RPM package to install or
configure the PEM server or PEM agent, please see the *PEM Installation
Guide*, available at:

## Upgrading SQL Profiler on a Linux host

To upgrade a SQL Profiler installation that resides on a Linux host:

1.  Delete the existing SQL Profiler query set on each node by invoking
    the `uninstall-sql-profiler.sql` script.
    
    By default, if you are using Advanced Server on a Linux host that
    was installed with a graphical installer, the script resides in the
    `share/contrib` directory under the Advanced Server installation.
    
    If you are using a PostgreSQL installation on a Linux host, the
    script resides in the `share/postgresql/contrib` directory under the
    PostgreSQL installation.

2.  Use the following command on the node you wish to profile:
    
    > `yum install
    > postgresql<pg_version>-sqlprofiler-<sql_profiler_version>`

Where, *pg_version* is the version of the postgres and
*sqlprofiler_version* is the SQL Profiler version.

> After updating the PEM components, you are ready to update the backing
> database.
