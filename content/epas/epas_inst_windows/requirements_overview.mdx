## Supported Platforms

The Advanced Server 12 graphical installers are supported on the
following 64 bit Windows platforms:

  - Windows Server 2019
  - Windows Server 2016
  - Windows Server 2012 R2

**Limitations**

The following limitations apply to EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

  - The `data` directory of a production database should not be stored
    on an NFS file system.

## Windows Installation Prerequisites

**User Privileges**

To perform an Advanced Server installation on a Windows system, you must
have administrator privileges. If you are installing Advanced Server on
a Windows system that is configured with `User Account Control` enabled,
you can assume sufficient privileges to invoke the graphical installer
by right clicking on the name of the installer and selecting `Run as
administrator` from the context menu.

**Windows-specific Software Requirements**

You should apply Windows operating system updates before invoking the
Advanced Server installer. If (during the installation process) the
installer encounters errors, exit the installation, and ensure that your
version of Windows is up-to-date before restarting the installer.

**Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus Installation Pre-requisites**

Before using a StackBuilder Plus to install Migration Toolkit or
EDB\*Plus, you must first install Java (version 1.8 or later). If you
are using Windows, Java installers and instructions are available online
