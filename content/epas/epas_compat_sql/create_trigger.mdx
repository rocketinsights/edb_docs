**Description**

`CREATE TRIGGER` defines a new trigger. `CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER` will
either create a new trigger, or replace an existing definition.

If you are using the `CREATE TRIGGER` keywords to create a new trigger,
the name of the new trigger must not match any existing trigger defined
on the same table. New triggers will be created in the same schema as
the table on which the triggering event is defined.

If you are updating the definition of an existing trigger, use the
`CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER` keywords.

When you use syntax that is compatible with Oracle to create a trigger,
the trigger runs as a `SECURITY DEFINER` function.

**Parameters**

`name`

> The name of the trigger to create.

`BEFORE | AFTER`

> Determines whether the trigger is fired before or after the triggering
> event.

`INSTEAD OF`

> `INSTEAD OF` trigger modifies an updatable view; the trigger will
> execute to update the underlying table(s) appropriately. The `INSTEAD
> OF` trigger is executed for each row of the view that is updated or
> modified.

`INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE`

> Defines the triggering event.

`table`

> The name of the table or view on which the triggering event occurs.

`condition`

> `condition` is a Boolean expression that determines if the trigger
> will actually be executed; if `condition` evaluates to `TRUE`, the
> trigger will fire.
> 
> If the trigger definition includes the `FOR EACH ROW` keywords, the
> `WHEN` clause can refer to columns of the old and/or new row values by
> writing `OLD.column_name` or `NEW.column_name` respectively. `INSERT`
> triggers cannot refer to `OLD` and `DELETE` triggers cannot refer to
> `NEW`.
> 
> If the trigger includes the `INSTEAD OF` keywords, it may not include
> a `WHEN` clause. A `WHEN` clause cannot contain subqueries.

`REFERENCING { OLD AS old | NEW AS new } ...`

> `REFERENCING` clause to reference old rows and new rows, but
> restricted in that *old* may only be replaced by an identifier named
> old or any equivalent that is saved in all lowercase (for example,
> `REFERENCING OLD AS old`, `REFERENCING OLD AS OLD`, or `REFERENCING
> OLD AS "old"`). Also, `new` may only be replaced by an identifier
> named new or any equivalent that is saved in all lowercase (for
> example, `REFERENCING NEW AS new`, `REFERENCING NEW AS NEW`, or
> `REFERENCING NEW AS "new"`).
> 
> Either one, or both phrases `OLD AS old` and `NEW AS new` may be
> specified in the `REFERENCING` clause (for example, `REFERENCING NEW
> AS New OLD AS Old`).
> 
> This clause is not compatible with Oracle databases in that
> identifiers other than `old` or `new` may not be used.

`FOR EACH ROW`

> Determines whether the trigger should be fired once for every row
> affected by the triggering event, or just once per SQL statement. If
> specified, the trigger is fired once for every affected row (row-level
> trigger), otherwise the trigger is a statement-level trigger.

`PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION`

> `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` is the directive that sets the trigger
> as an autonomous transaction.

`declaration`

> A variable, type, `REF CURSOR`, or subprogram declaration. If
> subprogram declarations are included, they must be declared after all
> other variable, type, and `REF CURSOR` declarations.

`statement`

> An SPL program statement. Note that a `DECLARE - BEGIN - END` block is
> considered an SPL statement unto itself. Thus, the trigger body may
> contain nested blocks.

`exception`

> An exception condition name such as `NO_DATA_FOUND`, `OTHERS`, etc.

**Examples**

The following is a statement-level trigger that fires after the
triggering statement (insert, update, or delete on table `emp`) is
executed.

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER user_audit_trig
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON emp
DECLARE
    v_action        VARCHAR2(24);
BEGIN
    IF INSERTING THEN
        v_action := ' added employee(s) on ';
    ELSIF UPDATING THEN
        v_action := ' updated employee(s) on ';
    ELSIF DELETING THEN
        v_action := ' deleted employee(s) on ';
    END IF;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('User ' || USER || v_action ||
        TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'YYYY-MM-DD'));
END;
```

The following is a row-level trigger that fires before each row is
either inserted, updated, or deleted on table `emp`.

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER emp_sal_trig
    BEFORE DELETE OR INSERT OR UPDATE ON emp
    FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
    sal_diff       NUMBER;
BEGIN
    IF INSERTING THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Inserting employee ' || :NEW.empno);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('..New salary: ' || :NEW.sal);
    END IF;
    IF UPDATING THEN
        sal_diff := :NEW.sal - :OLD.sal;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Updating employee ' || :OLD.empno);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('..Old salary: ' || :OLD.sal);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('..New salary: ' || :NEW.sal);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('..Raise     : ' || sal_diff);
    END IF;
    IF DELETING THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Deleting employee ' || :OLD.empno);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('..Old salary: ' || :OLD.sal);
    END IF;
END;
```

The following is an example of a compound trigger that records a change
to the employee salary by defining a compound trigger `HR_TRIGGER` on
table `EMP`.

First, create a table named `EMP`:

``` text
CREATE TABLE EMP(EMPNO INT, ENAME TEXT, SAL INT, DEPTNO INT);
CREATE TABLE
```

Then, create a compound trigger named `HR_TRIGGER`. The trigger utilizes
each of the four timing-points to modify the salary with an `INSERT`,
`UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. In the global declaration section, the
initial salary is declared as `10,000`:

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER HR_TRIGGER
  FOR INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON EMP
    COMPOUND TRIGGER
  -- Global declaration.
  var_sal NUMBER := 10000;

  BEFORE STATEMENT IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Before Statement: ' || var_sal);
  END BEFORE STATEMENT;

  BEFORE EACH ROW IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Before Each Row: ' || var_sal);
  END BEFORE EACH ROW;

  AFTER EACH ROW IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('After Each Row: ' || var_sal);
  END AFTER EACH ROW;

  AFTER STATEMENT IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('After Statement: ' || var_sal);
  END AFTER STATEMENT;

END HR_TRIGGER;

Output: Trigger created.
```

`INSERT` the record into table `EMP`.

``` text
INSERT INTO EMP(EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DEPTNO) VALUES(1111,'SMITH', 10000,
20);
```

The `INSERT` statement produces the following output:

``` text
Before Statement: 11000
Before each row: 12000
After each row: 13000
After statement: 14000
INSERT 0 1
```

The `UPDATE` statement will update the employee salary record, setting
the salary to `15000` for a specific employee number.

``` text
UPDATE EMP SET SAL = 15000 where EMPNO = 1111;
```

The `UPDATE` statement produces the following output:

``` text
Before Statement: 11000
Before each row: 12000
After each row: 13000
After statement: 14000
UPDATE 1

SELECT * from EMP;
 EMPNO | ENAME |  SAL  | DEPTNO
-------+-------+-------+--------
  1111 | SMITH | 15000 |     20
(1 row)
```

The `DELETE` statement deletes the employee salary record.

``` text
DELETE from EMP where EMPNO = 1111;
```

The `DELETE` statement produces the following output:

``` text
Before Statement: 11000
Before each row: 12000
After each row: 13000
After statement: 14000
DELETE 1

SELECT * from EMP;
 EMPNO | ENAME | SAL | DEPTNO
-------+-------+-----+--------
(0 rows)
```

The `TRUNCATE` statement removes all the records from the `EMP` table.

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER HR_TRIGGER
  FOR TRUNCATE ON EMP
    COMPOUND TRIGGER
  -- Global declaration.
  var_sal NUMBER := 10000;
  BEFORE STATEMENT IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Before Statement: ' || var_sal);
  END BEFORE STATEMENT;

  AFTER STATEMENT IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('After Statement: ' || var_sal);
  END AFTER STATEMENT;

END HR_TRIGGER;

Output: Trigger created.
```

The `TRUNCATE` statement produces the following output:

``` text
TRUNCATE EMP;
Before Statement: 11000
After statement: 12000
TRUNCATE TABLE
```

**Note:** The `TRUNCATE` statement may be used only at a `BEFORE
STATEMENT` or `AFTER STATEMENT` timing-point.
