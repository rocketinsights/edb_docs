Advanced Server includes extra syntax (not offered by Oracle) for the
`ALTER ROLE` command. This syntax can be useful when assigning
privileges related to creating and dropping database links compatible
with Oracle databases, and fine-grained access control (using
`DBMS_RLS`).

**CREATE DATABASE LINK**

A user who holds the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` privilege may create a
private database link. The following `ALTER ROLE` command grants
privileges to an Advanced Server role that allow the specified role to
create a private database link:

``` text
ALTER ROLE role_name
    WITH [CREATEDBLINK | CREATE DATABASE LINK]
```

This command is the functional equivalent of:

``` text
GRANT CREATE DATABASE LINK to role_name
```

Use the following command to revoke the privilege:

``` text
ALTER ROLE role_name
  WITH [NOCREATEDBLINK | NO CREATE DATABASE LINK]
```

Please note: the `CREATEDBLINK` and `NOCREATEDBLINK` keywords should be
considered deprecated syntax; we recommend using the `CREATE DATABASE
LINK` and `NO CREATE DATABASE LINK` syntax options.

**CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK**

A user who holds the `CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK` privilege may create
a public database link. The following `ALTER ROLE` command grants
privileges to an Advanced Server role that allow the specified role to
create a public database link:

``` text
ALTER ROLE role_name
  WITH [CREATEPUBLICDBLINK | CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK]
```

This command is the functional equivalent of:

``` text
GRANT CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK to role_name
```

Use the following command to revoke the privilege:

``` text
ALTER ROLE role_name
  WITH [NOCREATEPUBLICDBLINK | NO CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK]
```

Please note: the `CREATEPUBLICDBLINK` and `NOCREATEPUBLICDBLINK`
keywords should be considered deprecated syntax; we recommend using the
`CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK` and `NO CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK`
syntax options.

**DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK**

A user who holds the `DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK` privilege may drop a
public database link. The following `ALTER ROLE` command grants
privileges to an Advanced Server role that allow the specified role to
drop a public database link:

``` text
ALTER ROLE role_name
  WITH [DROPPUBLICDBLINK | DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK]
```

This command is the functional equivalent of:

``` text
GRANT DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK to role_name
```

Use the following command to revoke the privilege:

``` text
ALTER ROLE role_name
  WITH [NODROPPUBLICDBLINK | NO DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK]
```

Please note: the `DROPPUBLICDBLINK` and `NODROPPUBLICDBLINK` keywords
should be considered deprecated syntax; we recommend using the `DROP
PUBLIC DATABASE LINK` and `NO DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK` syntax options.

**EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY**

A user who holds the `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` privilege is exempt from
fine-grained access control (`DBMS_RLS`) policies. A user who holds
these privileges will be able to view or modify any row in a table
constrained by a `DBMS_RLS` policy. The following `ALTER ROLE` command
grants privileges to an Advanced Server role that exempt the specified
role from any defined `DBMS_RLS` policies:

``` text
ALTER ROLE role_name
    WITH [POLICYEXEMPT | EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY]
```

This command is the functional equivalent of:

``` text
GRANT EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY TO role_name
```

Use the following command to revoke the privilege:

``` text
ALTER ROLE role_name
  WITH [NOPOLICYEXEMPT | NO EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY]
```

Please note: the `POLICYEXEMPT` and `NOPOLICYEXEMPT` keywords should be
considered deprecated syntax; we recommend using the `EXEMPT ACCESS
POLICY` and `NO EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` syntax options.
