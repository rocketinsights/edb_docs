**Name**

`ROLLBACK --` abort the current transaction

**Synopsis**

``` text
ROLLBACK [ WORK ]
```

**Description**

`ROLLBACK` rolls back the current transaction and causes all the updates
made by the transaction to be discarded.

**Parameters**

`WORK`

> Optional key word - has no effect.

**Notes**

Use `COMMIT` to successfully terminate a transaction.

Issuing `ROLLBACK` when not inside a transaction does no harm.

Please note: Executing a `ROLLBACK` in a plpgsql procedure will throw an
error if there is an Oracle-style SPL procedure on the runtime stack.

**Examples**

To abort all changes:

``` text
ROLLBACK;
```

`COMMIT <commit>`, `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT <rollback_to_savepoint>`,
`SAVEPOINT <savepoint>`
